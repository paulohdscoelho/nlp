start of thi project gutenberg ebook the republ produc by sue asscher the republ by plato translat by benjamin jowett note the republ by plato jowett etext introduct and analysi the republ of plato is the longest of hi work with the except of the law and is certainli the greatest of them there ar nearer approach to modern metaphys in the philebu and in the sophist the politicu or statesman is more ideal the form and institut of the state ar more clearli drawn out in the law as work of art the symposium and the protagora ar of higher excel but no other dialogu of plato ha the same larg of view and the same perfect of style no other show an equal knowledg of the world or contain more of those thought which ar new as well as old and not of on ag onli but of all nowher in plato is there a deeper ironi or a greater wealth of humour or imageri or more dramat power nor in ani other of hi write is the attempt made to interweav life and specul or to connect polit with philosophi the republ is the centr around which the other dialogu mai be group here philosophi reach the highest point cp especi in book v vi vii to which ancient thinker ever attain plato among the greek like bacon among the modern wa the first who conceiv a method of knowledg although neither of them alwai distinguish the bare outlin or form from the substanc of truth and both of them had to be content with an abstract of scienc which wa not yet realiz he wa the greatest metaphys geniu whom the world ha seen and in him more than in ani other ancient thinker the germ of futur knowledg ar contain the scienc of logic and psycholog which have suppli so mani instrument of thought to afterag ar base upon the analys of socrat and plato the principl of definit the law of contradict the fallaci of argu in a circl the distinct between the essenc and accid of a thing or notion between mean and end between caus and condit also the divis of the mind into the ration concupisc and irasc element or of pleasur and desir into necessari and unnecessarythes and other great form of thought ar all of them to be found in the republ and were probabl first invent by plato the greatest of all logic truth and the on of which writer on philosophi ar most apt to lose sight the differ between word and thing ha been most strenuous insist on by him cp rep polit cratyl ff although he ha not alwai avoid the confus of them in hi own write eg rep but he doe not bind up truth in logic formulaelog is still veil in metaphys and the scienc which he imagin to contempl all truth and all exist is veri unlik the doctrin of the syllog which aristotl claim to have discov soph elenchi neither must we forget that the republ is but the third part of a still larger design which wa to have includ an ideal histori of athen as well as a polit and physic philosophi the fragment of the critia ha given birth to a worldfam fiction second onli in import to the tale of troi and the legend of arthur and is said as a fact to have inspir some of the earli navig of the sixteenth centuri thi mythic tale of which the subject wa a histori of the war of the athenian against the island of atlanti is suppos to be found upon an unfinish poem of solon to which it would have stood in the same relat as the write of the logograph to the poem of homer it would have told of a struggl for liberti cp tim c intend to repres the conflict of persia and hella we mai judg from the nobl commenc of the timaeu from the fragment of the critia itself and from the third book of the law in what manner plato would have treat thi high argument we can onli guess why the great design wa abandon perhap becaus plato becam sensibl of some incongru in a fictiti histori or becaus he had lost hi interest in it or becaus advanc year forbad the complet of it and we mai pleas ourselv with the fanci that had thi imaginari narr ever been finish we should have found plato himself sympathis with the struggl for hellen independ cp law iii ff sing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salami perhap make the reflect of herodotu v where he contempl the growth of the athenian empirehow brave a thing is freedom of speech which ha made the athenian so far exce everi other state of hella in great or more probabl attribut the victori to the ancient good order of athen and to the favor of apollo and athen cp introd to critia again plato mai be regard as the captain arhchegoz or leader of a goodli band of follow for in the republ is to be found the origin of cicero de republica of st augustin citi of god of the utopia of sir thoma more and of the numer other imaginari state which ar frame upon the same model the extent to which aristotl or the aristotelian school were indebt to him in the polit ha been littl recognis and the recognit is the more necessari becaus it is not made by aristotl himself the two philosoph had more in common than thei were consciou of and probabl some element of plato remain still undetect in aristotl in english philosophi too mani affin mai be trace not onli in the work of the cambridg platonist but in great origin writer like berkelei or coleridg to plato and hi idea that there is a truth higher than experi of which the mind bear wit to herself is a convict which in our own gener ha been enthusiast assert and is perhap gain ground of the greek author who at the renaiss brought a new life into the world plato ha had the greatest influenc the republ of plato is also the first treatis upon educ of which the write of milton and lock rousseau jean paul and goeth ar the legitim descend like dant or bunyan he ha a revel of anoth life like bacon he is profoundli impress with the uniti of knowledg in the earli church he exercis a real influenc on theologi and at the reviv of literatur on polit even the fragment of hi word when repeat at secondhand symp d have in all ag ravish the heart of men who have seen reflect in them their own higher natur he is the father of ideal in philosophi in polit in literatur and mani of the latest concept of modern thinker and statesmen such as the uniti of knowledg the reign of law and the equal of the sex have been anticip in a dream by him the argument of the republ is the search after justic the natur of which is first hint at by cephalu the just and blameless old manthen discuss on the basi of proverbi moral by socrat and polemarchusthen caricatur by thrasymachu and partial explain by socratesreduc to an abstract by glaucon and adeimantu and have becom invis in the individu reappear at length in the ideal state which is construct by socrat the first care of the ruler is to be educ of which an outlin is drawn after the old hellen model provid onli for an improv religion and moral and more simplic in music and gymnast a manlier strain of poetri and greater harmoni of the individu and the state we ar thu led on to the concept of a higher state in which no man call anyth hi own and in which there is neither marri nor give in marriag and king ar philosoph and philosoph ar king and there is anoth and higher educ intellectu as well as moral and religi of scienc as well as of art and not of youth onli but of the whole of life such a state is hardli to be realiz in thi world and quickli degener to the perfect ideal succe the govern of the soldier and the lover of honour thi again declin into democraci and democraci into tyranni in an imaginari but regular order have not much resembl to the actual fact when the wheel ha come full circl we do not begin again with a new period of human life but we have pass from the best to the worst and there we end the subject is then chang and the old quarrel of poetri and philosophi which had been more lightli treat in the earlier book of the republ is now resum and fought out to a conclus poetri is discov to be an imit thrice remov from the truth and homer as well as the dramat poet have been condemn as an imit is sent into banish along with them and the idea of the state is supplement by the revel of a futur life the divis into book like all similar divis cp sir gc lewi in the classic museum vol ii p is probabl later than the ag of plato the natur divis ar five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraph begin i had alwai admir the geniu of glaucon and adeimantu which is introductori the first book contain a refut of the popular and sophist notion of justic and conclud like some of the earlier dialogu without arriv at ani definit result to thi is append a restat of the natur of justic accord to common opinion and an answer is demand to the questionwhat is justic strip of appear the second divis includ the remaind of the second and the whole of the third and fourth book which ar mainli occupi with the construct of the first state and the first educ the third divis consist of the fifth sixth and seventh book in which philosophi rather than justic is the subject of enquiri and the second state is construct on principl of commun and rule by philosoph and the contempl of the idea of good take the place of the social and polit virtu in the eighth and ninth book the pervers of state and of the individu who correspond to them ar review in success and the natur of pleasur and the principl of tyranni ar further analys in the individu man the tenth book is the conclus of the whole in which the relat of philosophi to poetri ar final determin and the happi of the citizen in thi life which ha now been assur is crown by the vision of anoth or a more gener divis into two part mai be adopt the first book i iv contain the descript of a state frame gener in accord with hellen notion of religion and moral while in the second book v x the hellen state is transform into an ideal kingdom of philosophi of which all other govern ar the pervers these two point of view ar realli oppos and the opposit is onli veil by the geniu of plato the republ like the phaedru see introduct to phaedru is an imperfect whole the higher light of philosophi break through the regular of the hellen templ which at last fade awai into the heaven whether thi imperfect of structur aris from an enlarg of the plan or from the imperfect reconcil in the writer own mind of the struggl element of thought which ar now first brought togeth by him or perhap from the composit of the work at differ timesar question like the similar question about the iliad and the odyssei which ar worth ask but which cannot have a distinct answer in the ag of plato there wa no regular mode of public and an author would have the less scrupl in alter or ad to a work which wa known onli to a few of hi friend there is no absurd in suppos that he mai have laid hi labour asid for a time or turn from on work to anoth and such interrupt would be more like to occur in the case of a long than of a short write in all attempt to determin the chronolog order of the platon write on intern evid thi uncertainti about ani singl dialogu be compos at on time is a disturb element which must be admit to affect longer work such as the republ and the law more than shorter on but on the other hand the seem discrep of the republ mai onli aris out of the discord element which the philosoph ha attempt to unit in a singl whole perhap without be himself abl to recognis the inconsist which is obviou to us for there is a judgment of after ag which few great writer have ever been abl to anticip for themselv thei do not perceiv the want of connexion in their own write or the gap in their system which ar visibl enough to those who come after them in the begin of literatur and philosophi amid the first effort of thought and languag more inconsist occur than now when the path of specul ar well worn and the mean of word precis defin for consist too is the growth of time and some of the greatest creation of the human mind have been want in uniti tri by thi test sever of the platon dialogu accord to our modern idea appear to be defect but the defici is no proof that thei were compos at differ time or by differ hand and the supposit that the republ wa written uninterruptedli and by a continu effort is in some degre confirm by the numer refer from on part of the work to anoth the second titl concern justic is not the on by which the republ is quot either by aristotl or gener in antiqu and like the other second titl of the platon dialogu mai therefor be assum to be of later date morgenstern and other have ask whether the definit of justic which is the profess aim or the construct of the state is the princip argument of the work the answer is that the two blend in on and ar two face of the same truth for justic is the order of the state and the state is the visibl embodi of justic under the condit of human societi the on is the soul and the other is the bodi and the greek ideal of the state as of the individu is a fair mind in a fair bodi in hegelian phraseolog the state is the realiti of which justic is the idea or describ in christian languag the kingdom of god is within and yet develop into a church or extern kingdom the hous not made with hand etern in the heaven is reduc to the proport of an earthli build or to us a platon imag justic and the state ar the warp and the woof which run through the whole textur and when the constitut of the state is complet the concept of justic is not dismiss but reappear under the same or differ name throughout the work both as the inner law of the individu soul and final as the principl of reward and punish in anoth life the virtu ar base on justic of which common honesti in bui and sell is the shadow and justic is base on the idea of good which is the harmoni of the world and is reflect both in the institut of state and in motion of the heavenli bodi cp tim the timaeu which take up the polit rather than the ethic side of the republ and is chiefli occupi with hypothes concern the outward world yet contain mani indic that the same law is suppos to reign over the state over natur and over man too much howev ha been made of thi question both in ancient and modern time there is a stage of critic in which all work whether of natur or of art ar refer to design now in ancient write and inde in literatur gener there remain often a larg element which wa not comprehend in the origin design for the plan grow under the author hand new thought occur to him in the act of write he ha not work out the argument to the end befor he begin the reader who seek to find some on idea under which the whole mai be conceiv must necessarili seiz on the vaguest and most gener thu stallbaum who is dissatisfi with the ordinari explan of the argument of the republ imagin himself to have found the true argument in the represent of human life in a state perfect by justic and govern accord to the idea of good there mai be some us in such gener descript but thei can hardli be said to express the design of the writer the truth is that we mai as well speak of mani design as of on nor need anyth be exclud from the plan of a great work to which the mind is natur led by the associ of idea and which doe not interfer with the gener purpos what kind or degre of uniti is to be sought after in a build in the plastic art in poetri in prose is a problem which ha to be determin rel to the subjectmatt to plato himself the enquiri what wa the intent of the writer or what wa the princip argument of the republ would have been hardli intellig and therefor had better be at onc dismiss cp the introduct to the phaedru is not the republ the vehicl of three or four great truth which to plato own mind ar most natur repres in the form of the state just as in the jewish prophet the reign of messiah or the dai of the lord or the suffer servant or peopl of god or the sun of righteous with heal in hi wing onli convei to us at least their great spiritu ideal so through the greek state plato reveal to us hi own thought about divin perfect which is the idea of goodlik the sun in the visibl worldabout human perfect which is justiceabout educ begin in youth and continu in later yearsabout poet and sophist and tyrant who ar the fals teacher and evil ruler of mankindabout the world which is the embodi of themabout a kingdom which exist nowher upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life no such inspir creation is at uniti with itself ani more than the cloud of heaven when the sun pierc through them everi shade of light and dark of truth and of fiction which is the veil of truth is allow in a work of philosoph imagin it is not all on the same plane it easili pass from idea to myth and fanci from fact to figur of speech it is not prose but poetri at least a great part of it and ought not to be judg by the rule of logic or the probabl of histori the writer is not fashion hi idea into an artist whole thei take possess of him and ar too much for him we have no need therefor to discuss whether a state such as plato ha conceiv is practic or not or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer for the practic of hi idea ha noth to do with their truth and the highest thought to which he attain mai be truli said to bear the greatest mark of designjustic more than the extern framework of the state the idea of good more than justic the great scienc of dialect or the organis of idea ha no real content but is onli a type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledg is to be pursu by the spectat of all time and all exist it is in the fifth sixth and seventh book that plato reach the summit of specul and these although thei fail to satisfi the requir of a modern thinker mai therefor be regard as the most import as thei ar also the most origin portion of the work it is not necessari to discuss at length a minor question which ha been rais by boeckh respect the imaginari date at which the convers wa held the year bc which is propos by him will do as well as ani other for a writer of fiction and especi a writer who like plato is notori careless of chronolog cp rep symp a etc onli aim at gener probabl whether all the person mention in the republ could ever have met at ani on time is not a difficulti which would have occur to an athenian read the work forti year later or to plato himself at the time of write ani more than to shakespear respect on of hi own drama and need not greatli troubl us now yet thi mai be a question have no answer which is still worth ask becaus the investig show that we cannot argu histor from the date in plato it would be useless therefor to wast time in invent farfetch reconcil of them in order to avoid chronolog difficulti such for exampl as the conjectur of cf hermann that glaucon and adeimantu ar not the brother but the uncl of plato cp apol a or the fanci of stallbaum that plato intention left anachron indic the date at which some of hi dialogu were written the princip charact in the republ ar cephalu polemarchu thrasymachu socrat glaucon and adeimantu cephalu appear in the introduct onli polemarchu drop at the end of the first argument and thrasymachu is reduc to silenc at the close of the first book the main discuss is carri on by socrat glaucon and adeimantu among the compani ar lysia the orat and euthydemu the son of cephalu and brother of polemarchu an unknown charmantidesthes ar mute auditor also there is cleitophon who onc interrupt where as in the dialogu which bear hi name he appear as the friend and alli of thrasymachu cephalu the patriarch of the hous ha been appropri engag in offer a sacrific he is the pattern of an old man who ha almost done with life and is at peac with himself and with all mankind he feel that he is draw nearer to the world below and seem to linger around the memori of the past he is eager that socrat should come to visit him fond of the poetri of the last gener happi in the conscious of a wellspent life glad at have escap from the tyranni of youth lust hi love of convers hi affect hi indiffer to rich even hi garrul ar interest trait of charact he is not on of those who have noth to sai becaus their whole mind ha been absorb in make monei yet he acknowledg that rich have the advantag of place men abov the temptat to dishonesti or falsehood the respect attent shown to him by socrat whose love of convers no less than the mission impos upon him by the oracl lead him to ask question of all men young and old alik should also be note who better suit to rais the question of justic than cephalu whose life might seem to be the express of it the moder with which old ag is pictur by cephalu as a veri toler portion of exist is characterist not onli of him but of greek feel gener and contrast with the exagger of cicero in the de senectut the even of life is describ by plato in the most express manner yet with the fewest possibl touch as cicero remark ep ad attic iv the ag cephalu would have been out of place in the discuss which follow and which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a violat of dramat proprieti cp lysimachu in the lach hi son and heir polemarchu ha the frank and impetu of youth he is for detain socrat by forc in the open scene and will not let him off on the subject of women and children like cephalu he is limit in hi point of view and repres the proverbi stage of moral which ha rule of life rather than principl and he quot simonid cp aristoph cloud as hi father had quot pindar but after thi he ha no more to sai the answer which he make ar onli elicit from him by the dialect of socrat he ha not yet experienc the influenc of the sophist like glaucon and adeimantu nor is he sensibl of the necess of refut them he belong to the presocrat or predialect ag he is incap of argu and is bewild by socrat to such a degre that he doe not know what he is sai he is made to admit that justic is a thief and that the virtu follow the analog of the art from hi brother lysia contra eratosth we learn that he fell a victim to the thirti tyrant but no allus is here made to hi fate nor to the circumst that cephalu and hi famili were of syracusan origin and had migrat from thurii to athen the chalcedonian giant thrasymachu of whom we have alreadi heard in the phaedru is the personif of the sophist accord to plato concept of them in some of their worst characterist he is vain and bluster refus to discours unless he is paid fond of make an orat and hope therebi to escap the inevit socrat but a mere child in argument and unabl to forese that the next move to us a platon express will shut him up he ha reach the stage of frame gener notion and in thi respect is in advanc of cephalu and polemarchu but he is incap of defend them in a discuss and vainli tri to cover hi confus with banter and insol whether such doctrin as ar attribut to him by plato were realli held either by him or by ani other sophist is uncertain in the infanc of philosophi seriou error about moral might easili grow upthei ar certainli put into the mouth of speaker in thucydid but we ar concern at present with plato descript of him and not with the histor realiti the inequ of the contest add greatli to the humour of the scene the pompou and empti sophist is utterli helpless in the hand of the great master of dialect who know how to touch all the spring of vaniti and weak in him he is greatli irrit by the ironi of socrat but hi noisi and imbecil rage onli lai him more and more open to the thrust of hi assail hi determin to cram down their throat or put bodili into their soul hi own word elicit a cry of horror from socrat the state of hi temper is quit as worthi of remark as the process of the argument noth is more amus than hi complet submiss when he ha been onc thoroughli beaten at first he seem to continu the discuss with reluct but soon with appar goodwil and he even testifi hi interest at a later stage by on or two occasion remark when attack by glaucon he is humor protect by socrat as on who ha never been hi enemi and is now hi friend from cicero and quintilian and from aristotl rhetor we learn that the sophist whom plato ha made so ridicul wa a man of note whose write were preserv in later ag the plai on hi name which wa made by hi contemporari herodicu ari rhet thou wast ever bold in battl seem to show that the descript of him is not devoid of verisimilitud when thrasymachu ha been silenc the two princip respond glaucon and adeimantu appear on the scene here as in greek tragedi cp introd to phaedo three actor ar introduc at first sight the two son of ariston mai seem to wear a famili like like the two friend simmia and cebe in the phaedo but on a nearer examin of them the similar vanish and thei ar seen to be distinct charact glaucon is the impetu youth who can just never have enough of fecht cp the charact of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasur who is acquaint with the mysteri of love the juveni qui gaudet canibu and who improv the breed of anim the lover of art and music who ha all the experi of youth life he is full of quick and penetr pierc easili below the clumsi platitud of thrasymachu to the real difficulti he turn out to the light the seami side of human life and yet doe not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon who seiz what mai be term the ludicr relat of the philosoph to the world to whom a state of simplic is a citi of pig who is alwai prepar with a jest when the argument offer him an opportun and who is ever readi to second the humour of socrat and to appreci the ridicul whether in the connoisseur of music or in the lover of theatric or in the fantast behaviour of the citizen of democraci hi weak ar sever time allud to by socrat who howev will not allow him to be attack by hi brother adeimantu he is a soldier and like adeimantu ha been distinguish at the battl of megara anno the charact of adeimantu is deeper and graver and the profound object ar commonli put into hi mouth glaucon is more demonstr and gener open the game adeimantu pursu the argument further glaucon ha more of the liveli and quick sympathi of youth adeimantu ha the matur judgment of a grownup man of the world in the second book when glaucon insist that justic and injustic shall be consid without regard to their consequ adeimantu remark that thei ar regard by mankind in gener onli for the sake of their consequ and in a similar vein of reflect he urg at the begin of the fourth book that socrat fail in make hi citizen happi and is answer that happi is not the first but the second thing not the direct aim but the indirect consequ of the good govern of a state in the discuss about religion and mytholog adeimantu is the respond but glaucon break in with a slight jest and carri on the convers in a lighter tone about music and gymnast to the end of the book it is adeimantu again who volunt the critic of common sens on the socrat method of argument and who refus to let socrat pass lightli over the question of women and children it is adeimantu who is the respond in the more argument as glaucon in the lighter and more imagin portion of the dialogu for exampl throughout the greater part of the sixth book the caus of the corrupt of philosophi and the concept of the idea of good ar discuss with adeimantu glaucon resum hi place of princip respond but he ha a difficulti in apprehend the higher educ of socrat and make some fals hit in the cours of the discuss onc more adeimantu return with the allus to hi brother glaucon whom he compar to the contenti state in the next book he is again supersed and glaucon continu to the end thu in a success of charact plato repres the success stage of moral begin with the athenian gentleman of the olden time who is follow by the practic man of that dai regul hi life by proverb and saw to him succe the wild gener of the sophist and lastli come the young discipl of the great teacher who know the sophist argument but will not be convinc by them and desir to go deeper into the natur of thing these too like cephalu polemarchu thrasymachu ar clearli distinguish from on anoth neither in the republ nor in ani other dialogu of plato is a singl charact repeat the delin of socrat in the republ is not wholli consist in the first book we have more of the real socrat such as he is depict in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliest dialogu of plato and in the apolog he is iron provok question the old enemi of the sophist readi to put on the mask of silenu as well as to argu serious but in the sixth book hi enmiti toward the sophist abat he acknowledg that thei ar the repres rather than the corrupt of the world he also becom more dogmat and construct pass beyond the rang either of the polit or the specul idea of the real socrat in on passag plato himself seem to intim that the time had now come for socrat who had pass hi whole life in philosophi to give hi own opinion and not to be alwai repeat the notion of other men there is no evid that either the idea of good or the concept of a perfect state were comprehend in the socrat teach though he certainli dwelt on the natur of the univers and of final caus cp xen mem phaedo and a deep thinker like him in hi thirti or forti year of public teach could hardli have fail to touch on the natur of famili relat for which there is also some posit evid in the memorabilia mem the socrat method is nomin retain and everi infer is either put into the mouth of the respond or repres as the common discoveri of him and socrat but ani on can see that thi is a mere form of which the affect grow wearisom as the work advanc the method of enquiri ha pass into a method of teach in which by the help of interlocutor the same thesi is look at from variou point of view the natur of the process is truli character by glaucon when he describ himself as a companion who is not good for much in an investig but can see what he is shown and mai perhap give the answer to a question more fluentli than anoth neither can we be absolut certain that socrat himself taught the immort of the soul which is unknown to hi discipl glaucon in the republ cp apol nor is there ani reason to suppos that he us myth or revel of anoth world as a vehicl of instruct or that he would have banish poetri or have denounc the greek mytholog hi favorit oath is retain and a slight mention is made of the daemonium or intern sign which is allud to by socrat as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real element of socrat teach which is more promin in the republ than in ani of the other dialogu of plato is the us of exampl and illustr greek let us appli the test of common instanc you sai adeimantu iron in the sixth book ar so unaccustom to speak in imag and thi us of exampl or imag though truli socrat in origin is enlarg by the geniu of plato into the form of an allegori or parabl which embodi in the concret what ha been alreadi describ or is about to be describ in the abstract thu the figur of the cave in book vii is a recapitul of the divis of knowledg in book vi the composit anim in book ix is an allegori of the part of the soul the nobl captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi ar a figur of the relat of the peopl to the philosoph in the state which ha been describ other figur such as the dog or the marriag of the portionless maiden or the drone and wasp in the eighth and ninth book also form link of connexion in long passag or ar us to recal previou discuss plato is most true to the charact of hi master when he describ him as not of thi world and with thi represent of him the ideal state and the other paradox of the republ ar quit in accord though thei cannot be shown to have been specul of socrat to him as to other great teacher both philosoph and religi when thei look upward the world seem to be the embodi of error and evil the common sens of mankind ha revolt against thi view or ha onli partial admit it and even in socrat himself the sterner judgement of the multitud at time pass into a sort of iron piti or love men in gener ar incap of philosophi and ar therefor at enmiti with the philosoph but their misunderstand of him is unavoid for thei have never seen him as he truli is in hi own imag thei ar onli acquaint with artifici system possess no nativ forc of truthword which admit of mani applic their leader have noth to measur with and ar therefor ignor of their own statur but thei ar to be piti or laugh at not to be quarrel with thei mean well with their nostrum if thei could onli learn that thei ar cut off a hydra head thi moder toward those who ar in error is on of the most characterist featur of socrat in the republ in all the differ represent of socrat whether of xenophon or plato and amid the differ of the earlier or later dialogu he alwai retain the charact of the unweari and disinterest seeker after truth without which he would have ceas to be socrat leav the charact we mai now analys the content of the republ and then proce to consid the gener aspect of thi hellen ideal of the state the modern light in which the thought of plato mai be read book i the republ open with a truli greek scenea festiv in honour of the goddess bendi which is held in the piraeu to thi is ad the promis of an equestrian torchrac in the even the whole work is suppos to be recit by socrat on the dai after the festiv to a small parti consist of critia timaeu hermocr and anoth thi we learn from the first word of the timaeu when the rhetor advantag of recit the dialogu ha been gain the attent is not distract by ani refer to the audienc nor is the reader further remind of the extraordinari length of the narr of the numer compani three onli take ani seriou part in the discuss nor ar we inform whether in the even thei went to the torchrac or talk as in the symposium through the night the manner in which the convers ha arisen is describ as followssocr and hi companion glaucon ar about to leav the festiv when thei ar detain by a messag from polemarchu who speedili appear accompani by adeimantu the brother of glaucon and with play violenc compel them to remain promis them not onli the torchrac but the pleasur of convers with the young which to socrat is a far greater attract thei return to the hous of cephalu polemarchu father now in extrem old ag who is found sit upon a cushion seat crown for a sacrific you should come to me often socrat for i am too old to go to you and at my time of life have lost other pleasur i care the more for convers socrat ask him what he think of ag to which the old man repli that the sorrow and discont of ag ar to be attribut to the temper of men and that ag is a time of peac in which the tyranni of the passion is no longer felt ye repli socrat but the world will sai cephalu that you ar happi in old ag becaus you ar rich and there is someth in what thei sai socrat but not so much as thei imaginea themistocl repli to the seriphian neither you if you had been an athenian nor i if i had been a seriphian would ever have been famou i might in like manner repli to you neither a good poor man can be happi in ag nor yet a bad rich man socrat remark that cephalu appear not to care about rich a qualiti which he ascrib to hi have inherit not acquir them and would like to know what he consid to be the chief advantag of them cephalu answer that when you ar old the belief in the world below grow upon you and then to have done justic and never to have been compel to do injustic through poverti and never to have deceiv anyon ar felt to be unspeak bless socrat who is evid prepar for an argument next ask what is the mean of the word justic to tell the truth and pai your debt no more than thi or must we admit except ought i for exampl to put back into the hand of my friend who ha gone mad the sword which i borrow of him when he wa in hi right mind there must be except and yet sai polemarchu the definit which ha been given ha the author of simonid here cephalu retir to look after the sacrific and bequeath as socrat faceti remark the possess of the argument to hi heir polemarchu the descript of old ag is finish and plato as hi manner is ha touch the keynot of the whole work in ask for the definit of justic first suggest the question which glaucon afterward pursu respect extern good and prepar for the conclud mythu of the world below in the slight allus of cephalu the portrait of the just man is a natur frontispiec or introduct to the long discours which follow and mai perhap impli that in all our perplex about the natur of justic there is no difficulti in discern who is a just man the first explan ha been support by a sai of simonid and now socrat ha a mind to show that the resolut of justic into two unconnect precept which have no common principl fail to satisfi the demand of dialect he proce what did simonid mean by thi sai of hi did he mean that i wa to give back arm to a madman no not in that case not if the parti ar friend and evil would result he meant that you were to do what wa proper good to friend and harm to enemi everi act doe someth to somebodi and follow thi analog socrat ask what is thi due and proper thing which justic doe and to whom he is answer that justic doe good to friend and harm to enemi but in what wai good or harm in make allianc with the on and go to war with the other then in time of peac what is the good of justic the answer is that justic is of us in contract and contract ar monei partnership ye but how in such partnership is the just man of more us than ani other man when you want to have monei safe kept and not us then justic will be us when monei is useless and there is anoth difficulti justic like the art of war or ani other art must be of opposit good at attack as well as at defenc at steal as well as at guard but then justic is a thief though a hero notwithstand like autolycu the homer hero who wa excel abov all men in theft and perjuryto such a pass have you and homer and simonid brought us though i do not forget that the thiev must be for the good of friend and the harm of enemi and still there aris anoth question ar friend to be interpret as real or seem enemi as real or seem and ar our friend to be onli the good and our enemi to be the evil the answer is that we must do good to our seem and real good friend and evil to our seem and real evil enemiesgood to the good evil to the evil but ought we to render evil for evil at all when to do so will onli make men more evil can justic produc injustic ani more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen or heat produc cold the final conclus is that no sage or poet ever said that the just return evil for evil thi wa a maxim of some rich and mighti man periand perdicca or ismenia the theban about bc thu the first stage of aphorist or unconsci moral is shown to be inadequ to the want of the ag the author of the poet is set asid and through the wind maze of dialect we make an approach to the christian precept of forgiv of injuri similar word ar appli by the persian mystic poet to the divin be when the question spirit is stir within himif becaus i do evil thou punishest me by evil what is the differ between thee and me in thi both plato and kheyam rise abov the level of mani christian theologian the first definit of justic easili pass into the second for the simpl word to speak the truth and pai your debt is substitut the more abstract to do good to your friend and harm to your enemi either of these explan give a suffici rule of life for plain men but thei both fall short of the precis of philosophi we mai note in pass the antiqu of casuistri which not onli aris out of the conflict of establish principl in particular case but also out of the effort to attain them and is prior as well as posterior to our fundament notion of moral the interrog of moral idea the appeal to the author of homer the conclus that the maxim do good to your friend and harm to your enemi be erron could not have been the word of ani great man ar all of them veri characterist of the platon socrat here thrasymachu who ha made sever attempt to interrupt but ha hitherto been kept in order by the compani take advantag of a paus and rush into the arena begin like a savag anim with a roar socrat he sai what folli is thiswhi do you agre to be vanquish by on anoth in a pretend argument he then prohibit all the ordinari definit of justic to which socrat repli that he cannot tell how mani twelv is if he is forbidden to sai x or x or x or x at first thrasymachu is reluct to argu but at length with a promis of payment on the part of the compani and of prais from socrat he is induc to open the game listen he sai my answer is that might is right justic the interest of the stronger now prais me let me understand you first do you mean that becaus polydama the wrestler who is stronger than we ar find the eat of beef for hi interest the eat of beef is also for our interest who ar not so strong thrasymachu is indign at the illustr and in pompou word appar intend to restor digniti to the argument he explain hi mean to be that the ruler make law for their own interest but suppos sai socrat that the ruler or stronger make a mistakethen the interest of the stronger is not hi interest thrasymachu is save from thi speedi downfal by hi discipl cleitophon who introduc the word thinksnot the actual interest of the ruler but what he think or what seem to be hi interest is justic the contradict is escap by the unmean evas for though hi real and appar interest mai differ what the ruler think to be hi interest will alwai remain what he think to be hi interest of cours thi wa not the origin assert nor is the new interpret accept by thrasymachu himself but socrat is not dispos to quarrel about word if as he significantli insinu hi adversari ha chang hi mind in what follow thrasymachu doe in fact withdraw hi admiss that the ruler mai make a mistak for he affirm that the ruler as a ruler is infal socrat is quit readi to accept the new posit which he equal turn against thrasymachu by the help of the analog of the art everi art or scienc ha an interest but thi interest is to be distinguish from the accident interest of the artist and is onli concern with the good of the thing or person which come under the art and justic ha an interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judg but of those who come under hi swai thrasymachu is on the brink of the inevit conclus when he make a bold divers tell me socrat he sai have you a nurs what a question why do you ask becaus if you have she neglect you and let you go about drivel and ha not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep for you fanci that shepherd and ruler never think of their own interest but onli of their sheep or subject wherea the truth is that thei fatten them for their us sheep and subject alik and experi prove that in everi relat of life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer especi where injustic is on the grand scale which is quit anoth thing from the petti rogueri of swindler and burglar and robber of templ the languag of men prove thisour graciou and bless tyrant and the likeal which tend to show that justic is the interest of the stronger and that injustic is more profit and also stronger than justic thrasymachu who is better at a speech than at a close argument have delug the compani with word ha a mind to escap but the other will not let him go and socrat add a humbl but earnest request that he will not desert them at such a crisi of their fate and what can i do more for you he sai would you have me put the word bodili into your soul god forbid repli socrat but we want you to be consist in the us of term and not to emploi physician in an exact sens and then again shepherd or ruler in an inexactif the word ar strictli taken the ruler and the shepherd look onli to the good of their peopl or flock and not to their own wherea you insist that ruler ar sole actuat by love of offic no doubt about it repli thrasymachu then why ar thei paid is not the reason that their interest is not comprehend in their art and is therefor the concern of anoth art the art of pai which is common to the art in gener and therefor not ident with ani on of them nor would ani man be a ruler unless he were induc by the hope of reward or the fear of punishmentth reward is monei or honour the punish is the necess of be rule by a man wors than himself and if a state or church were compos entir of good men thei would be affect by the last motiv onli and there would be as much nolo episcopari as there is at present of the opposit the satir on exist govern is heighten by the simpl and appar incident manner in which the last remark is introduc there is a similar ironi in the argument that the governor of mankind do not like be in offic and that therefor thei demand pai enough of thi the other assert of thrasymachu is far more importantthat the unjust life is more gain than the just now as you and i glaucon ar not convinc by him we must repli to him but if we try to compar their respect gain we shall want a judg to decid for us we had better therefor proce by make mutual admiss of the truth to on anoth thrasymachu had assert that perfect injustic wa more gain than perfect justic and after a littl hesit he is induc by socrat to admit the still greater paradox that injustic is virtu and justic vice socrat prais hi frank and assum the attitud of on whose onli wish is to understand the mean of hi oppon at the same time he is weav a net in which thrasymachu is final enclos the admiss is elicit from him that the just man seek to gain an advantag over the unjust onli but not over the just while the unjust would gain an advantag over either socrat in order to test thi statement emploi onc more the favourit analog of the art the musician doctor skill artist of ani sort doe not seek to gain more than the skill but onli more than the unskil that is to sai he work up to a rule standard law and doe not exce it wherea the unskil make random effort at excess thu the skill fall on the side of the good and the unskil on the side of the evil and the just is the skill and the unjust is the unskil there wa great difficulti in bring thrasymachu to the point the dai wa hot and he wa stream with perspir and for the first time in hi life he wa seen to blush but hi other thesi that injustic wa stronger than justic ha not yet been refut and socrat now proce to the consider of thi which with the assist of thrasymachu he hope to clear up the latter is at first churlish but in the judici hand of socrat is soon restor to goodhumour is there not honour among thiev is not the strength of injustic onli a remnant of justic is not absolut injustic absolut weak also a hous that is divid against itself cannot stand two men who quarrel detract from on anoth strength and he who is at war with himself is the enemi of himself and the god not wicked therefor but semiwicked flourish in statesa remnant of good is need in order to make union in action possiblether is no kingdom of evil in thi world anoth question ha not been answer is the just or the unjust the happier to thi we repli that everi art ha an end and an excel or virtu by which the end is accomplish and is not the end of the soul happi and justic the excel of the soul by which happi is attain justic and happi be thu shown to be insepar the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier ha disappear thrasymachu repli let thi be your entertain socrat at the festiv of bendi ye and a veri good entertain with which your kind ha suppli me now that you have left off scold and yet not a good entertainmentbut that wa my own fault for i tast of too mani thing first of all the natur of justic wa the subject of our enquiri and then whether justic is virtu and wisdom or evil and folli and then the compar advantag of just and unjust and the sum of all is that i know not what justic is how then shall i know whether the just is happi or not thu the sophist fabric ha been demolish chiefli by appeal to the analog of the art justic is like the art in have no extern interest and in not aim at excess and justic is to happi what the implement of the workman is to hi work at thi the modern reader is apt to stumbl becaus he forget that plato is write in an ag when the art and the virtu like the moral and intellectu faculti were still undistinguish among earli enquir into the natur of human action the art help to fill up the void of specul and at first the comparison of the art and the virtu wa not perceiv by them to be fallaci thei onli saw the point of agreement in them and not the point of differ virtu like art must take mean to an end good manner ar both an art and a virtu charact is natur describ under the imag of a statu and there ar mani other figur of speech which ar readili transfer from art to moral the next gener clear up these perplex or at least suppli after ag with a further analysi of them the contemporari of plato were in a state of transit and had not yet fulli realiz the commonsens distinct of aristotl that virtu is concern with action art with product nic eth or that virtu impli intent and constanc of purpos wherea art requir knowledg onli and yet in the absurd which follow from some us of the analog there seem to be an intim convei that virtu is more than art thi is impli in the reductio ad absurdum that justic is a thief and in the dissatisfact which socrat express at the final result the express an art of pai which is describ as common to all the art is not in accord with the ordinari us of languag nor is it emploi elsewher either by plato or by ani other greek writer it is suggest by the argument and seem to extend the concept of art to do as well as make anoth flaw or inaccuraci of languag mai be note in the word men who ar injur ar made more unjust for those who ar injur ar not necessarili made wors but onli harm or illtreat the second of the three argument that the just doe not aim at excess ha a real mean though wrap up in an enigmat form that the good is of the natur of the finit is a peculiarli hellen sentiment which mai be compar with the languag of those modern writer who speak of virtu as fit and of freedom as obedi to law the mathemat or logic notion of limit easili pass into an ethic on and even find a mytholog express in the concept of envi greek idea of measur equal order uniti proport still linger in the write of moralist and the true spirit of the fine art is better convei by such term than by superl when workmen strive to do better than well thei do confound their skill in covet king john the harmoni of the soul and bodi and of the part of the soul with on anoth a harmoni fairer than that of music note is the true hellen mode of conceiv the perfect of human natur in what mai be call the epilogu of the discuss with thrasymachu plato argu that evil is not a principl of strength but of discord and dissolut just touch the question which ha been often treat in modern time by theologian and philosoph of the neg natur of evil in the last argument we trace the germ of the aristotelian doctrin of an end and a virtu direct toward the end which again is suggest by the art the final reconcil of justic and happi and the ident of the individu and the state ar also intim socrat reassum the charact of a knownoth at the same time he appear to be not wholli satisfi with the manner in which the argument ha been conduct noth is conclud but the tendenc of the dialect process here as alwai is to enlarg our concept of idea and to widen their applic to human life book ii thrasymachu is pacifi but the intrepid glaucon insist on continu the argument he is not satisfi with the indirect manner in which at the end of the last book socrat had dispos of the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier he begin by divid good into three classesfirst good desir in themselv secondli good desir in themselv and for their result thirdli good desir for their result onli he then ask socrat in which of the three class he would place justic in the second class repli socrat among good desir for themselv and also for their result then the world in gener ar of anoth mind for thei sai that justic belong to the troublesom class of good which ar desir for their result onli socrat answer that thi is the doctrin of thrasymachu which he reject glaucon think that thrasymachu wa too readi to listen to the voic of the charmer and propos to consid the natur of justic and injustic in themselv and apart from the result and reward of them which the world is alwai din in hi ear he will first of all speak of the natur and origin of justic secondli of the manner in which men view justic as a necess and not a good and thirdli he will prove the reason of thi view to do injustic is said to be a good to suffer injustic an evil as the evil is discov by experi to be greater than the good the suffer who cannot also be doer make a compact that thei will have neither and thi compact or mean is call justic but is realli the imposs of do injustic no on would observ such a compact if he were not oblig let us suppos that the just and unjust have two ring like that of gyge in the wellknown stori which make them invis and then no differ will appear in them for everi on will do evil if he can and he who abstain will be regard by the world as a fool for hi pain men mai prais him in public out of fear for themselv but thei will laugh at him in their heart cp gorgia and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust imagin the unjust man to be master of hi craft seldom make mistak and easili correct them have gift of monei speech strengthth greatest villain bear the highest charact and at hi side let us place the just in hi nobl and simplicityb not seemingwithout name or rewardcloth in hi justic onlyth best of men who is thought to be the worst and let him die as he ha live i might add but i would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrist of injusticethei will tell you that the just man will be scourg rack bound will have hi ey put out and will at last be crucifi liter impaledand all thi becaus he ought to have prefer seem to be how differ is the case of the unjust who cling to appear as the true realiti hi high charact make him a ruler he can marri where he like trade where he like help hi friend and hurt hi enemi have got rich by dishonesti he can worship the god better and will therefor be more love by them than the just i wa think what to answer when adeimantu join in the alreadi unequ frai he consid that the most import point of all had been omittedmen ar taught to be just for the sake of reward parent and guardian make reput the incent to virtu and other advantag ar promis by them of a more solid kind such as wealthi marriag and high offic there ar the pictur in homer and hesiod of fat sheep and heavi fleec rich cornfield and tree toppl with fruit which the god provid in thi life for the just and the orphic poet add a similar pictur of anoth the hero of musaeu and eumolpu lie on couch at a festiv with garland on their head enjoi as the meed of virtu a paradis of immort drunken some go further and speak of a fair poster in the third and fourth gener but the wick thei buri in a slough and make them carri water in a siev and in thi life thei attribut to them the infami which glaucon wa assum to be the lot of the just who ar suppos to be unjust take anoth kind of argument which is found both in poetri and prosevirtu as hesiod sai is honour but difficult vice is easi and profit you mai often see the wick in great prosper and the righteou afflict by the will of heaven and mendic prophet knock at rich men door promis to aton for the sin of themselv or their father in an easi fashion with sacrific and festiv game or with charm and invoc to get rid of an enemi good or bad by divin help and at a small chargethei appeal to book profess to be written by musaeu and orpheu and carri awai the mind of whole citi and promis to get soul out of purgatori and if we refus to listen to them no on know what will happen to us when a livelymind ingenu youth hear all thi what will be hi conclus will he in the languag of pindar make justic hi high tower or fortifi himself with crook deceit justic he reflect without the appear of justic is miseri and ruin injustic ha the promis of a gloriou life appear is master of truth and lord of happi to appear then i will turni will put on the show of virtu and trail behind me the fox of archilochu i hear some on sai that wicked is not easili conceal to which i repli that noth great is easi union and forc and rhetor will do much and if men sai that thei cannot prevail over the god still how do we know that there ar god onli from the poet who acknowledg that thei mai be appeas by sacrific then why not sin and pai for indulg out of your sin for if the righteou ar onli unpunish still thei have no further reward while the wick mai be unpunish and have the pleasur of sin too but what of the world below nai sai the argument there ar aton power who will set that matter right as the poet who ar the son of the god tell us and thi is confirm by the author of the state how can we resist such argument in favour of injustic add good manner and as the wise tell us we shall make the best of both world who that is not a miser caitiff will refrain from smile at the prais of justic even if a man know the better part he will not be angri with other for he know also that more than human virtu is need to save a man and that he onli prais justic who is incap of injustic the origin of the evil is that all men from the begin hero poet instructor of youth have alwai assert the tempor dispens the honour and profit of justic had we been taught in earli youth the power of justic and injustic inher in the soul and unseen by ani human or divin ey we should not have need other to be our guardian but everi on would have been the guardian of himself thi is what i want you to show socratesoth men us argument which rather tend to strengthen the posit of thrasymachu that might is right but from you i expect better thing and pleas as glaucon said to exclud reput let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just and do you still prove to us the superior of justic the thesi which for the sake of argument ha been maintain by glaucon is the convers of that of thrasymachusnot right is the interest of the stronger but right is the necess of the weaker start from the same premis he carri the analysi of societi a step further backmight is still right but the might is the weak of the mani combin against the strength of the few there have been theori in modern as well as in ancient time which have a famili like to the specul of glaucon eg that power is the foundat of right or that a monarch ha a divin right to govern well or ill or that virtu is selflov or the love of power or that war is the natur state of man or that privat vice ar public benefit all such theori have a kind of plausibl from their partial agreement with experi for human natur oscil between good and evil and the motiv of action and the origin of institut mai be explain to a certain extent on either hypothesi accord to the charact or point of view of a particular thinker the oblig of maintain author under all circumst and sometim by rather question mean is felt strongli and ha becom a sort of instinct among civil men the divin right of king or more gener of govern is on of the form under which thi natur feel is express nor again is there ani evil which ha not some accompani of good or pleasur nor ani good which is free from some alloi of evil nor ani nobl or gener thought which mai not be attend by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of selfinterest or of selflov we know that all human action ar imperfect but we do not therefor attribut them to the wors rather than to the better motiv or principl such a philosophi is both foolish and fals like that opinion of the clever rogu who assum all other men to be like himself and theori of thi sort do not repres the real natur of the state which is base on a vagu sens of right gradual correct and enlarg by custom and law although capabl also of pervers ani more than thei describ the origin of societi which is to be sought in the famili and in the social and religi feel of man nor do thei repres the averag charact of individu which cannot be explain simpli on a theori of evil but ha alwai a counteract element of good and as men becom better such theori appear more and more untruth to them becaus thei ar more consciou of their own disinterested a littl experi mai make a man a cynic a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier view of the mix natur of himself and hi fellow men the two brother ask socrat to prove to them that the just is happi when thei have taken from him all that in which happi is ordinarili suppos to consist not that there is ani absurd in the attempt to frame a notion of justic apart from circumst for the ideal must alwai be a paradox when compar with the ordinari condit of human life neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true as a fact but thei mai serv as a basi of educ and mai exercis an ennobl influenc an ideal is none the wors becaus some on ha made the discoveri that no such ideal wa ever realiz and in a few except individu who ar rais abov the ordinari level of human the ideal of happi mai be realiz in death and miseri thi mai be the state which the reason deliber approv and which the utilitarian as well as everi other moralist mai be bound in certain case to prefer nor again must we forget that plato though he agre gener with the view impli in the argument of the two brother is not express hi own final conclus but rather seek to dramat on of the aspect of ethic truth he is develop hi idea gradual in a seri of posit or situat he is exhibit socrat for the first time undergo the socrat interrog lastli the word happi involv some degre of confus becaus associ in the languag of modern philosophi with consciou pleasur or satisfact which wa not equal present to hi mind glaucon ha been draw a pictur of the miseri of the just and the happi of the unjust to which the miseri of the tyrant in book ix is the answer and parallel and still the unjust must appear just that is the homag which vice pai to virtu but now adeimantu take up the hint which had been alreadi given by glaucon proce to show that in the opinion of mankind justic is regard onli for the sake of reward and reput and point out the advantag which is given to such argument as those of thrasymachu and glaucon by the convent moral of mankind he seem to feel the difficulti of justifi the wai of god to man both the brother touch upon the question whether the moral of action is determin by their consequ and both of them go beyond the posit of socrat that justic belong to the class of good not desir for themselv onli but desir for themselv and for their result to which he recal them in their attempt to view justic as an intern principl and in their condemn of the poet thei anticip him the common life of greec is not enough for them thei must penetr deeper into the natur of thing it ha been object that justic is honesti in the sens of glaucon and adeimantu but is taken by socrat to mean all virtu mai we not more truli sai that the oldfashion notion of justic is enlarg by socrat and becom equival to univers order or wellb first in the state and secondli in the individu he ha found a new answer to hi old question protag whether the virtu ar on or mani viz that on is the order principl of the three other in seek to establish the pure intern natur of justic he is met by the fact that man is a social be and he tri to harmonis the two opposit these as well as he can there is no more inconsist in thi than wa inevit in hi ag and countri there is no us in turn upon him the cross light of modern philosophi which from some other point of view would appear equal inconsist plato doe not give the final solut of philosoph question for us nor can he be judg of by our standard the remaind of the republ is develop out of the question of the son of ariston three point ar deserv of remark in what immedi followsfirst that the answer of socrat is altogeth indirect he doe not sai that happi consist in the contempl of the idea of justic and still less will he be tempt to affirm the stoical paradox that the just man can be happi on the rack but first he dwell on the difficulti of the problem and insist on restor man to hi natur condit befor he will answer the question at all he too will frame an ideal but hi ideal comprehend not onli abstract justic but the whole relat of man under the fanci illustr of the larg letter he impli that he will onli look for justic in societi and that from the state he will proce to the individu hi answer in substanc amount to thisthat under favour condit ie in the perfect state justic and happi will coincid and that when justic ha been onc found happi mai be left to take care of itself that he fall into some degre of inconsist when in the tenth book he claim to have got rid of the reward and honour of justic mai be admit for he ha left those which exist in the perfect state and the philosoph who retir under the shelter of a wall can hardli have been esteem happi by him at least not in thi world still he maintain the true attitud of moral action let a man do hi duti first without ask whether he will be happi or not and happi will be the insepar accid which attend him seek ye first the kingdom of god and hi righteous and all these thing shall be ad unto you secondli it mai be remark that plato preserv the genuin charact of greek thought in begin with the state and in go on to the individu first ethic then politicsthi is the order of idea to us the revers is the order of histori onli after mani struggl of thought doe the individu assert hi right as a moral be in earli ag he is not on but on of mani the citizen of a state which is prior to him and he ha no notion of good or evil apart from the law of hi countri or the creed of hi church and to thi type he is constantli tend to revert whenev the influenc of custom or of parti spirit or the recollect of the past becom too strong for him thirdli we mai observ the confus or identif of the individu and the state of ethic and polit which pervad earli greek specul and even in modern time retain a certain degre of influenc the subtl differ between the collect and individu action of mankind seem to have escap earli thinker and we too ar sometim in danger of forget the condit of unit human action whenev we either elev polit into ethic or lower ethic to the standard of polit the good man and the good citizen onli coincid in the perfect state and thi perfect cannot be attain by legisl act upon them from without but if at all by educ fashion them from within socrat prais the son of ariston inspir offspr of the renown hero as the elegiac poet term them but he doe not understand how thei can argu so eloqu on behalf of injustic while their charact show that thei ar uninfluenc by their own argument he know not how to answer them although he is afraid of desert justic in the hour of need he therefor make a condit that have weak ey he shall be allow to read the larg letter first and then go on to the smaller that is he must look for justic in the state first and will then proce to the individu accordingli he begin to construct the state societi aris out of the want of man hi first want is food hi second a hous hi third a coat the sens of these need and the possibl of satisfi them by exchang draw individu togeth on the same spot and thi is the begin of a state which we take the liberti to invent although necess is the real inventor there must be first a husbandman secondli a builder thirdli a weaver to which mai be ad a cobbler four or five citizen at least ar requir to make a citi now men have differ natur and on man will do on thing better than mani and busi wait for no man henc there must be a divis of labour into differ employ into wholesal and retail trade into worker and maker of workmen tool into shepherd and husbandmen a citi which includ all thi will have far exceed the limit of four or five and yet not be veri larg but then again import will be requir and import necessit export and thi impli varieti of produc in order to attract the tast of purchas also merchant and ship in the citi too we must have a market and monei and retail trade otherwis buyer and seller will never meet and the valuabl time of the produc will be wast in vain effort at exchang if we add hire servant the state will be complet and we mai guess that somewher in the intercours of the citizen with on anoth justic and injustic will appear here follow a rustic pictur of their wai of life thei spend their dai in hous which thei have built for themselv thei make their own cloth and produc their own corn and wine their princip food is meal and flour and thei drink in moder thei live on the best of term with each other and take care not to have too mani children but said glaucon interpos ar thei not to have a relish certainli thei will have salt and oliv and chees veget and fruit and chestnut to roast at the fire ti a citi of pig socrat why i repli what do you want more onli the comfort of lifesofa and tabl also sauc and sweet i see you want not onli a state but a luxuri state and possibl in the more complex frame we mai sooner find justic and injustic then the fine art must go to workeveri conceiv instrument and ornament of luxuri will be want there will be dancer painter sculptor musician cook barber tirewomen nurs artist swineherd and neatherd too for the anim and physician to cure the disord of which luxuri is the sourc to feed all these superflu mouth we shall need a part of our neighbour land and thei will want a part of our and thi is the origin of war which mai be trace to the same caus as other polit evil our citi will now requir the slight addit of a camp and the citizen will be convert into a soldier but then again our old doctrin of the divis of labour must not be forgotten the art of war cannot be learn in a dai and there must be a natur aptitud for militari duti there will be some warlik natur who have thi aptitudedog keen of scent swift of foot to pursu and strong of limb to fight and as spirit is the foundat of courag such natur whether of men or anim will be full of spirit but these spirit natur ar apt to bite and devour on anoth the union of gentl to friend and fierc against enemi appear to be an imposs and the guardian of a state requir both qualiti who then can be a guardian the imag of the dog suggest an answer for dog ar gentl to friend and fierc to stranger your dog is a philosoph who judg by the rule of know or not know and philosophi whether in man or beast is the parent of gentl the human watchdog must be philosoph or lover of learn which will make them gentl and how ar thei to be learn without educ but what shall their educ be is ani better than the oldfashion sort which is comprehend under the name of music and gymnast music includ literatur and literatur is of two kind true and fals what do you mean he said i mean that children hear stori befor thei learn gymnast and that the stori ar either untru or have at most on or two grain of truth in a bushel of falsehood now earli life is veri impress and children ought not to learn what thei will have to unlearn when thei grow up we must therefor have a censorship of nurseri tale banish some and keep other some of them ar veri improp as we mai see in the great instanc of homer and hesiod who not onli tell li but bad li stori about uranu and saturn which ar immor as well as fals and which should never be spoken of to young person or inde at all or if at all then in a mysteri after the sacrific not of an eleusinian pig but of some unprocur anim shall our youth be encourag to beat their father by the exampl of zeu or our citizen be incit to quarrel by hear or see represent of strife among the god shall thei listen to the narr of hephaestu bind hi mother and of zeu send him fly for help her when she wa beaten such tale mai possibl have a mystic interpret but the young ar incap of understand allegori if ani on ask what tale ar to be allow we will answer that we ar legisl and not bookmak we onli lai down the principl accord to which book ar to be written to write them is the duti of other and our first principl is that god must be repres as he is not as the author of all thing but of good onli we will not suffer the poet to sai that he is the steward of good and evil or that he ha two cask full of destiniesor that athen and zeu incit pandaru to break the treati or that god caus the suffer of niob or of pelop or the trojan war or that he make men sin when he wish to destroi them either these were not the action of the god or god wa just and men were the better for be punish but that the deed wa evil and god the author is a wick suicid fiction which we will allow no on old or young to utter thi is our first and great principlegod is the author of good onli and the second principl is like unto itwith god is no variabl or chang of form reason teach us thi for if we suppos a chang in god he must be chang either by anoth or by himself by anotherbut the best work of natur and art and the noblest qualiti of mind ar least liabl to be chang by ani extern forc by himselfbut he cannot chang for the better he will hardli chang for the wors he remain for ever fairest and best in hi own imag therefor we refus to listen to the poet who tell us of here beg in the like of a priestess or of other deiti who prowl about at night in strang disguis all that blasphem nonsens with which mother fool the manhood out of their children must be suppress but some on will sai that god who is himself unchang mai take a form in relat to us why should he for god as well as men hate the lie in the soul or principl of falsehood and as for ani other form of ly which is us for a purpos and is regard as innoc in certain except caseswhat need have the god of thi for thei ar not ignor of antiqu like the poet nor ar thei afraid of their enemi nor is ani madman a friend of their god then is true he is absolut true he chang not he deceiv not by dai or night by word or sign thi is our second great principlegod is true awai with the ly dream of agamemnon in homer and the accus of theti against apollo in aeschylu in order to give clear to hi concept of the state plato proce to trace the first principl of mutual need and of divis of labour in an imaginari commun of four or five citizen gradual thi commun increas the divis of labour extend to countri import necessit export a medium of exchang is requir and retail sit in the marketplac to save the time of the produc these ar the step by which plato construct the first or primit state introduc the element of polit economi by the wai as he is go to frame a second or civil state the simpl natur come befor the complex he indulg like rousseau in a pictur of primit lifean idea which ha inde often had a power influenc on the imagin of mankind but he doe not serious mean to sai that on is better than the other politicu nor can ani infer be drawn from the descript of the first state taken apart from the second such as aristotl appear to draw in the polit we should not interpret a platon dialogu ani more than a poem or a parabl in too liter or matteroffact a style on the other hand when we compar the live fanci of plato with the driedup abstract of modern treatis on philosophi we ar compel to sai with protagora that the mythu is more interest protag sever interest remark which in modern time would have a place in a treatis on polit economi ar scatter up and down the write of plato especi law popul free trade adulter will and bequest beg eryxia though not plato valu and demand republ divis of labour the last subject and also the origin of retail trade is treat with admir lucid in the second book of the republ but plato never combin hi econom idea into a system and never seem to have recogn that trade is on of the great motiv power of the state and of the world he would make retail trader onli of the inferior sort of citizen rep law though he remark quaintli enough law that if onli the best men and the best women everywher were compel to keep tavern for a time or to carri on retail trade etc then we should knew how pleasant and agreeabl all these thing ar the disappoint of glaucon at the citi of pig the ludicr descript of the minist of luxuri in the more refin state and the afterthought of the necess of doctor the illustr of the natur of the guardian taken from the dog the desir of offer some almost unprocur victim when impur mysteri ar to be celebr the behaviour of zeu to hi father and of hephaestu to hi mother ar touch of humour which have also a seriou mean in speak of educ plato rather startl us by affirm that a child must be train in falsehood first and in truth afterward yet thi is not veri differ from sai that children must be taught through the medium of imagin as well as reason that their mind can onli develop gradual and that there is much which thei must learn without understand thi is also the substanc of plato view though he must be acknowledg to have drawn the line somewhat differ from modern ethic writer respect truth and falsehood to us economi or accommod would not be allow unless thei were requir by the human faculti or necessari for the commun of knowledg to the simpl and ignor we should insist that the word wa insepar from the intent and that we must not be fals true ie speak or act fals in support of what wa right or true but plato would limit the us of fiction onli by requir that thei should have a good moral effect and that such a danger weapon as falsehood should be emploi by the ruler alon and for great object a greek in the ag of plato attach no import to the question whether hi religion wa an histor fact he wa just begin to be consciou that the past had a histori but he could see noth beyond homer and hesiod whether their narr were true or fals did not serious affect the polit or social life of hella men onli began to suspect that thei were fiction when thei recognis them to be immor and so in all religion the consider of their moral come first afterward the truth of the document in which thei ar record or of the event natur or supernatur which ar told of them but in modern time and in protest countri perhap more than in cathol we have been too much inclin to identifi the histor with the moral and some have refus to believ in religion at all unless a superhuman accuraci wa discern in everi part of the record the fact of an ancient or religi histori ar amongst the most import of all fact but thei ar frequent uncertain and we onli learn the true lesson which is to be gather from them when we place ourselv abov them these reflect tend to show that the differ between plato and ourselv though not unimport is not so great as might at first sight appear for we should agre with him in place the moral befor the histor truth of religion and gener in disregard those error or misstat of fact which necessarili occur in the earli stage of all religion we know also that chang in the tradit of a countri cannot be made in a dai and ar therefor toler of mani thing which scienc and critic would condemn we note in pass that the allegor interpret of mytholog said to have been first introduc as earli as the sixth centuri befor christ by theagen of rhegium wa well establish in the ag of plato and here as in the phaedru though for a differ reason wa reject by him that anachron whether of religion or law when men have reach anoth stage of civil should be got rid of by fiction is in accord with univers experi great is the art of interpret and by a natur process which when onc discov wa alwai go on what could not be alter wa explain awai and so without ani palpabl inconsist there exist side by side two form of religion the tradit inherit or invent by the poet and the customari worship of the templ on the other hand there wa the religion of the philosoph who wa dwell in the heaven of idea but did not therefor refus to offer a cock to aesculapiu or to be seen sai hi prayer at the rise of the sun at length the antagon between the popular and philosoph religion never so great among the greek as in our own ag disappear and wa onli felt like the differ between the religion of the educ and uneduc among ourselv the zeu of homer and hesiod easili pass into the royal mind of plato philebu the giant heracl becam the knighterr and benefactor of mankind these and still more wonder transform were readili effect by the ingenu of stoic and neoplatonist in the two or three centuri befor and after christ the greek and roman religion were gradual permeat by the spirit of philosophi have lost their ancient mean thei were resolv into poetri and moral and probabl were never purer than at the time of their decai when their influenc over the world wa wane a singular concept which occur toward the end of the book is the lie in the soul thi is connect with the platon and socrat doctrin that involuntari ignor is wors than voluntari the lie in the soul is a true lie the corrupt of the highest truth the decept of the highest part of the soul from which he who is deceiv ha no power of deliv himself for exampl to repres god as fals or immor or accord to plato as delud men with appear or as the author of evil or again to affirm with protagora that knowledg is sensat or that be is becom or with thrasymachu that might is right would have been regard by plato as a lie of thi hate sort the greatest unconsci of the greatest untruth eg if in the languag of the gospel john he who wa blind were to sai i see is anoth aspect of the state of mind which plato is describ the lie in the soul mai be further compar with the sin against the holi ghost luke allow for the differ between greek and christian mode of speak to thi is oppos the lie in word which is onli such a decept as mai occur in a plai or poem or allegori or figur of speech or in ani sort of accommodationwhich though useless to the god mai be us to men in certain case socrat is here answer the question which he had himself rais about the proprieti of deceiv a madman and he is also contrast the natur of god and man for god is truth but mankind can onli be true by appear sometim to be partial or fals reserv for anoth place the greater question of religion or educ we mai note further the approv of the old tradit educ of greec the prepar which plato is make for the attack on homer and the poet the prepar which he is also make for the us of economi in the state the contemptu and at the same time euphemist manner in which here as below he allud to the chroniqu scandaleus of the god book iii there is anoth motiv in purifi religion which is to banish fear for no man can be courag who is afraid of death or who believ the tale which ar repeat by the poet concern the world below thei must be gentli request not to abus hell thei mai be remind that their stori ar both untru and discourag nor must thei be angri if we expung obnoxi passag such as the depress word of achillesi would rather be a servingman than rule over all the dead and the vers which tell of the squalid mansion the senseless shadow the flit soul mourn over lost strength and youth the soul with a gibber go beneath the earth like smoke or the soul of the suitor which flutter about like bat the terror and horror of cocytu and styx ghost and sapless shade and the rest of their tartarean nomenclatur must vanish such tale mai have their us but thei ar not the proper food for soldier as littl can we admit the sorrow and sympathi of the homer heroesachil the son of theti in tear throw ash on hi head or pace up and down the seashor in distract or priam the cousin of the god cry aloud roll in the mire a good man is not prostrat at the loss of children or fortun neither is death terribl to him and therefor lament over the dead should not be practis by men of note thei should be the concern of inferior person onli whether women or men still wors is the attribut of such weak to the god as when the goddess sai ala my travail and worst of all when the king of heaven himself lament hi inabl to save hector or sorrow over the impend doom of hi dear sarpedon such a charact of god if not ridicul by our young men is like to be imit by them nor should our citizen be given to excess of laughtersuch violent delight ar follow by a violent reaction the descript in the iliad of the god shake their side at the clumsi of hephaestu will not be admit by us certainli not truth should have a high place among the virtu for falsehood as we were sai is useless to the god and onli us to men as a medicin but thi employ of falsehood must remain a privileg of state the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler ani more than the patient would tell a lie to hi physician or the sailor to hi captain in the next place our youth must be temper and temper consist in selfcontrol and obedi to author that is a lesson which homer teach in some place the achaean march on breath prowess in silent aw of their leadersbut a veri differ on in other place o heavi with wine who hast the ey of a dog but the heart of a stag languag of the latter kind will not impress selfcontrol on the mind of youth the same mai be said about hi prais of eat and drink and hi dread of starvat also about the vers in which he tell of the raptur love of zeu and here or of how hephaestu onc detain ar and aphrodit in a net on a similar occas there is a nobler strain heard in the wordsendur my soul thou hast endur wors nor must we allow our citizen to receiv bribe or to sai gift persuad the god gift reverend king or to applaud the ignobl advic of phoenix to achil that he should get monei out of the greek befor he assist them or the mean of achil himself in take gift from agamemnon or hi requir a ransom for the bodi of hector or hi curs of apollo or hi insol to the rivergod scamand or hi dedic to the dead patroclu of hi own hair which had been alreadi dedic to the other rivergod spercheiu or hi cruelti in drag the bodi of hector round the wall and slai the captiv at the pyre such a combin of mean and cruelti in cheiron pupil is inconceiv the amatori exploit of peirith and theseu ar equal unworthi either these socal son of god were not the son of god or thei were not such as the poet imagin them ani more than the god themselv ar the author of evil the youth who believ that such thing ar done by those who have the blood of heaven flow in their vein will be too readi to imit their exampl enough of god and heroeswhat shall we sai about men what the poet and storytel saythat the wick prosper and the righteou ar afflict or that justic is anoth gain such misrepresent cannot be allow by us but in thi we ar anticip the definit of justic and had therefor better defer the enquiri the subject of poetri have been suffici treat next follow style now all poetri is a narr of event past present or to come and narr is of three kind the simpl the imit and a composit of the two an instanc will make my mean clear the first scene in homer is of the last or mix kind be partli descript and partli dialogu but if you throw the dialogu into the oratio obliqua the passag will run thu the priest came and prai apollo that the achaean might take troi and have a safe return if agamemnon would onli give him back hi daughter and the other greek assent but agamemnon wa wroth and so onth whole then becom descript and the poet is the onli speaker left or if you omit the narr the whole becom dialogu these ar the three styleswhich of them is to be admit into our state do you ask whether tragedi and comedi ar to be admit ye but also someth morei it not doubt whether our guardian ar to be imit at all or rather ha not the question been alreadi answer for we have decid that on man cannot in hi life plai mani part ani more than he can act both tragedi and comedi or be rhapsodist and actor at onc human natur is coin into veri small piec and as our guardian have their own busi alreadi which is the care of freedom thei will have enough to do without imit if thei imit thei should imit not ani mean or base but the good onli for the mask which the actor wear is apt to becom hi face we cannot allow men to plai the part of women quarrel weep scold or boast against the godsleast of all when make love or in labour thei must not repres slave or bulli or coward drunkard or madmen or blacksmith or neigh hors or bellow bull or sound river or a rage sea a good or wise man will be will to perform good and wise action but he will be asham to plai an inferior part which he ha never practis and he will prefer to emploi the descript style with as littl imit as possibl the man who ha no selfrespect on the contrari will imit anybodi and anyth sound of natur and cri of anim alik hi whole perform will be imit of gestur and voic now in the descript style there ar few chang but in the dramat there ar a great mani poet and musician us either or a compound of both and thi compound is veri attract to youth and their teacher as well as to the vulgar but our state in which on man plai on part onli is not adapt for complex and when on of these polyphon pantomim gentlemen offer to exhibit himself and hi poetri we will show him everi observ of respect but at the same time tell him that there is no room for hi kind in our state we prefer the rough honest poet and will not depart from our origin model law next as to the music a song or od ha three partsth subject the harmoni and the rhythm of which the two last ar depend upon the first as we banish strain of lament so we mai now banish the mix lydian harmoni which ar the harmoni of lament and as our citizen ar to be temper we mai also banish convivi harmoni such as the ionian and pure lydian two remainth dorian and phrygian the first for war the second for peac the on express of courag the other of obedi or instruct or religi feel and as we reject varieti of harmoni we shall also reject the manystring variouslyshap instrument which give utter to them and in particular the flute which is more complex than ani of them the lyre and the harp mai be permit in the town and the panspip in the field thu we have made a purgat of music and will now make a purgat of metr these should be like the harmoni simpl and suitabl to the occas there ar four note of the tetrachord and there ar three ratio of metr which have all their characterist and the feet have differ characterist as well as the rhythm but about thi you and i must ask damon the great musician who speak if i rememb rightli of a martial measur as well as of dactyl trochaic and iambic rhythm which he arrang so as to equal the syllabl with on anoth assign to each the proper quantiti we onli ventur to affirm the gener principl that the style is to conform to the subject and the metr to the style and that the simplic and harmoni of the soul should be reflect in them all thi principl of simplic ha to be learnt by everi on in the dai of hi youth and mai be gather anywher from the creativ and construct art as well as from the form of plant and anim other artist as well as poet should be warn against mean or unseemli sculptur and paint equal with music must conform to the law of simplic he who violat it cannot be allow to work in our citi and to corrupt the tast of our citizen for our guardian must grow up not amid imag of deform which will gradual poison and corrupt their soul but in a land of health and beauti where thei will drink in from everi object sweet and harmoni influenc and of all these influenc the greatest is the educ given by music which find a wai into the innermost soul and impart to it the sens of beauti and of deform at first the effect is unconsci but when reason arriv then he who ha been thu train welcom her as the friend whom he alwai knew as in learn to read first we acquir the element or letter separ and afterward their combin and cannot recogn reflect of them until we know the letter themselvesin like manner we must first attain the element or essenti form of the virtu and then trace their combin in life and experi there is a music of the soul which answer to the harmoni of the world and the fairest object of a music soul is the fair mind in the fair bodi some defect in the latter mai be excus but not in the former true love is the daughter of temper and temper is utterli oppos to the mad of bodili pleasur enough ha been said of music which make a fair end with love next we pass on to gymnast about which i would remark that the soul is relat to the bodi as a caus to an effect and therefor if we educ the mind we mai leav the educ of the bodi in her charg and need onli give a gener outlin of the cours to be pursu in the first place the guardian must abstain from strong drink for thei should be the last person to lose their wit whether the habit of the palaestra ar suitabl to them is more doubt for the ordinari gymnast is a sleepi sort of thing and if left off suddenli is apt to endang health but our warrior athlet must be wideawak dog and must also be inur to all chang of food and climat henc thei will requir a simpler kind of gymnast akin to their simpl music and for their diet a rule mai be found in homer who feed hi hero on roast meat onli and give them no fish although thei ar live at the seasid nor boil meat which involv an apparatu of pot and pan and if i am not mistaken he nowher mention sweet sauc sicilian cookeri and attic confect and corinthian courtezan which ar to gymnast what lydian and ionian melodi ar to music must be forbidden where gluttoni and intemper prevail the town quickli fill with doctor and pleader and law and medicin give themselv air as soon as the freemen of a state take an interest in them but what can show a more disgrac state of educ than to have to go abroad for justic becaus you have none of your own at home and yet there is a wors stage of the same diseasewhen men have learn to take a pleasur and pride in the twist and turn of the law not consid how much better it would be for them so to order their live as to have no need of a nod justic and there is a like disgrac in emploi a physician not for the cure of wound or epidem disord but becaus a man ha by lazi and luxuri contract diseas which were unknown in the dai of asclepiu how simpl is the homer practic of medicin eurypylu after he ha been wound drink a posset of pramnian wine which is of a heat natur and yet the son of asclepiu blame neither the damsel who give him the drink nor patroclu who is attend on him the truth is that thi modern system of nurs diseas wa introduc by herodicu the trainer who be of a sickli constitut by a compound of train and medicin tortur first himself and then a good mani other peopl and live a great deal longer than he had ani right but asclepiu would not practis thi art becaus he knew that the citizen of a wellord state have no leisur to be ill and therefor he adopt the kill or cure method which artisan and labour emploi thei must be at their busi thei sai and have no time for coddl if thei recov well if thei dont there is an end of them wherea the rich man is suppos to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill do you know a maxim of phocylidesthat when a man begin to be rich or perhap a littl sooner he should practis virtu but how can excess care of health be inconsist with an ordinari occup and yet consist with that practic of virtu which phocylid inculc when a student imagin that philosophi give him a headach he never doe anyth he is alwai unwel thi wa the reason why asclepiu and hi son practis no such art thei were act in the interest of the public and did not wish to preserv useless live or rais up a puni offspr to wretch sire honest diseas thei honestli cure and if a man wa wound thei appli the proper remedi and then let him eat and drink what he like but thei declin to treat intemper and worthless subject even though thei might have made larg fortun out of them as to the stori of pindar that asclepiu wa slain by a thunderbolt for restor a rich man to life that is a liefollow our old rule we must sai either that he did not take bribe or that he wa not the son of a god glaucon then ask socrat whether the best physician and the best judg will not be those who have had sever the greatest experi of diseas and of crime socrat draw a distinct between the two profess the physician should have had experi of diseas in hi own bodi for he cure with hi mind and not with hi bodi but the judg control mind by mind and therefor hi mind should not be corrupt by crime where then is he to gain experi how is he to be wise and also innoc when young a good man is apt to be deceiv by evildo becaus he ha no pattern of evil in himself and therefor the judg should be of a certain ag hi youth should have been innoc and he should have acquir insight into evil not by the practic of it but by the observ of it in other thi is the ideal of a judg the crimin turn detect is wonderfulli suspici but when in compani with good men who have experi he is at fault for he foolishli imagin that everi on is as bad as himself vice mai be known of virtu but cannot know virtu thi is the sort of medicin and thi the sort of law which will prevail in our state thei will be heal art to better natur but the evil bodi will be left to die by the on and the evil soul will be put to death by the other and the need of either will be greatli diminish by good music which will give harmoni to the soul and good gymnast which will give health to the bodi not that thi divis of music and gymnast realli correspond to soul and bodi for thei ar both equal concern with the soul which is tame by the on and arous and sustain by the other the two togeth suppli our guardian with their twofold natur the passion disposit when it ha too much gymnast is harden and brutal the gentl or philosoph temper which ha too much music becom enerv while a man is allow music to pour like water through the funnel of hi ear the edg of hi soul gradual wear awai and the passion or spirit element is melt out of him too littl spirit is easili exhaust too much quickli pass into nervou irrit so again the athlet by feed and train ha hi courag doubl but he soon grow stupid he is like a wild beast readi to do everyth by blow and noth by counsel or polici there ar two principl in man reason and passion and to these not to the soul and bodi the two art of music and gymnast correspond he who mingl them in harmoni concord is the true musicianh shall be the presid geniu of our state the next question is who ar to be our ruler first the elder must rule the younger and the best of the elder will be the best guardian now thei will be the best who love their subject most and think that thei have a common interest with them in the welfar of the state these we must select but thei must be watch at everi epoch of life to see whether thei have retain the same opinion and held out against forc and enchant for time and persuas and the love of pleasur mai enchant a man into a chang of purpos and the forc of grief and pain mai compel him and therefor our guardian must be men who have been tri by mani test like gold in the refin fire and have been pass first through danger then through pleasur and at everi ag have come out of such trial victori and without stain in full command of themselv and their principl have all their faculti in harmoni exercis for their countri good these shall receiv the highest honour both in life and death it would perhap be better to confin the term guardian to thi select class the younger men mai be call auxiliari and now for on magnific lie in the belief of which oh that we could train our rulersat ani rate let us make the attempt with the rest of the world what i am go to tell is onli anoth version of the legend of cadmu but our unbeliev gener will be slow to accept such a stori the tale must be impart first to the ruler then to the soldier lastli to the peopl we will inform them that their youth wa a dream and that dure the time when thei seem to be undergo their educ thei were realli be fashion in the earth who sent them up when thei were readi and that thei must protect and cherish her whose children thei ar and regard each other as brother and sister i do not wonder at your be asham to propound such a fiction there is more behind these brother and sister have differ natur and some of them god frame to rule whom he fashion of gold other he made of silver to be auxiliari other again to be husbandmen and craftsmen and these were form by him of brass and iron but as thei ar all sprung from a common stock a golden parent mai have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and then there must be a chang of rank the son of the rich must descend and the child of the artisan rise in the social scale for an oracl sai that the state will come to an end if govern by a man of brass or iron will our citizen ever believ all thi not in the present gener but in the next perhap ye now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their ruler and look about and pitch their camp in a high place which will be safe against enemi from without and likewis against insurrect from within there let them sacrific and set up their tent for soldier thei ar to be and not shopkeep the watchdog and guardian of the sheep and luxuri and avaric will turn them into wolv and tyrant their habit and their dwell should correspond to their educ thei should have no properti their pai should onli meet their expens and thei should have common meal gold and silver we will tell them that thei have from god and thi divin gift in their soul thei must not alloi with that earthli dross which pass under the name of gold thei onli of the citizen mai not touch it or be under the same roof with it or drink from it it is the accurs thing should thei ever acquir hous or land or monei of their own thei will becom household and tradesmen instead of guardian enemi and tyrant instead of helper and the hour of ruin both to themselv and the rest of the state will be at hand the religi and ethic aspect of plato educ will hereaft be consid under a separ head some lesser point mai be more conveni notic in thi place the constant appeal to the author of homer whom with grave ironi plato after the manner of hi ag summon as a wit about ethic and psycholog as well as about diet and medicin attempt to distinguish the better lesson from the wors sometim alter the text from design more than onc quot or allud to homer inaccur after the manner of the earli logograph turn the iliad into prose and delight to draw farfetch infer from hi word or to make ludicr applic of them he doe not like heracleitu get into a rage with homer and archilochu heracl but us their word and express as vehicl of a higher truth not on a system like theagen of rhegium or metrodoru or in later time the stoic but as fanci mai dictat and the conclus drawn from them ar sound although the premis ar fictiti these fanci appeal to homer add a charm to plato style and at the same time thei have the effect of a satir on the folli of homer interpret to us and probabl to himself although thei take the form of argument thei ar realli figur of speech thei mai be compar with modern citat from scriptur which have often a great rhetor power even when the origin mean of the word is entir lost sight of the real like the platon socrat as we gather from the memorabilia of xenophon wa fond of make similar adapt great in all ag and countri in religion as well as in law and literatur ha been the art of interpret the style is to conform to the subject and the metr to the style notwithstand the fascin which the word classic exercis over us we can hardli maintain that thi rule is observ in all the greek poetri which ha come down to us we cannot deni that the thought often exce the power of lucid express in aeschylu and pindar or that rhetor get the better of the thought in the sophistpoet euripid onli perhap in sophocl is there a perfect harmoni of the two in him alon do we find a grace of languag like the beauti of a greek statu in which there is noth to add or to take awai at least thi is true of singl plai or of larg portion of them the connect in the tragic chorus and in the greek lyric poet is not unfrequ a tangl thread which in an ag befor logic the poet wa unabl to draw out mani thought and feel mingl in hi mind and he had no power of disengag or arrang them for there is a subtl influenc of logic which requir to be transfer from prose to poetri just as the music and perfect of languag ar infus by poetri into prose in all ag the poet ha been a bad judg of hi own mean apol for he doe not see that the word which is full of associ to hi own mind is difficult and unmean to that of anoth or that the sequenc which is clear to himself is puzzl to other there ar mani passag in some of our greatest modern poet which ar far too obscur in which there is no proport between style and subject in which ani halfexpress figur ani harsh construct ani distort colloc of word ani remot sequenc of idea is admit and there is no voic come sweetli from natur or music ad the express of feel to thought as if there could be poetri without beauti or beauti without eas and clear the obscur of earli greek poet aros necessarili out of the state of languag and logic which exist in their ag thei ar not exampl to be follow by us for the us of languag ought in everi gener to becom clearer and clearer like shakesper thei were great in spite not in consequ of their imperfect of express but there is no reason for return to the necessari obscur which prevail in the infanc of literatur the english poet of the last centuri were certainli not obscur and we have no excus for lose what thei had gain or for go back to the earlier or transit ag which preced them the thought of our own time ha not outstrip languag a want of plato art of measur is the rule caus of the disproport between them in the third book of the republ a nearer approach is made to a theori of art than anywher els in plato hi view mai be sum up as followstru art is not fanci and imit but simpl and idealth express of the highest moral energi whether in action or repos to live among work of plastic art which ar of thi nobl and simpl charact or to listen to such strain is the best of influencesth true greek atmospher in which youth should be brought up that is the wai to creat in them a natur good tast which will have a feel of truth and beauti in all thing for though the poet ar to be expel still art is recogn as anoth aspect of reasonlik love in the symposium extend over the same sphere but confin to the preliminari educ and act through the power of habit and thi concept of art is not limit to strain of music or the form of plastic art but pervad all natur and ha a wide kindr in the world the republ of plato like the athen of pericl ha an artist as well as a polit side there is hardli ani mention in plato of the creativ art onli in two or three passag doe he even allud to them rep soph he is not lost in raptur at the great work of phidia the parthenon the propylea the statu of zeu or athen he would probabl have regard ani abstract truth of number or figur as higher than the greatest of them yet it is hard to suppos that some influenc such as he hope to inspir in youth did not pass into hi own mind from the work of art which he saw around him we ar live upon the fragment of them and find in a few broken stone the standard of truth and beauti but in plato thi feel ha no express he nowher sai that beauti is the object of art he seem to deni that wisdom can take an extern form phaedru he doe not distinguish the fine from the mechan art whether or no like some writer he felt more than he express it is at ani rate remark that the greatest perfect of the fine art should coincid with an almost entir silenc about them in on veri strike passag he tell us that a work of art like the state is a whole and thi concept of a whole and the love of the newlyborn mathemat scienc mai be regard if not as the inspir at ani rate as the regul principl of greek art xen mem and sophist plato make the true and subtl remark that the physician had better not be in robust health and should have known what ill is in hi own person but the judg ought to have had no similar experi of evil he is to be a good man who have pass hi youth in innoc becam acquaint late in life with the vice of other and therefor accord to plato a judg should not be young just as a young man accord to aristotl is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophi the bad on the other hand have a knowledg of vice but no knowledg of virtu it mai be doubt howev whether thi train of reflect is well found in a remark passag of the law it is acknowledg that the evil mai form a correct estim of the good the union of gentl and courag in book ii at first seem to be a paradox yet wa afterward ascertain to be a truth and plato might also have found that the intuit of evil mai be consist with the abhorr of it there is a direct of aim in virtu which give an insight into vice and the knowledg of charact is in some degre a natur sens independ of ani special experi of good or evil on of the most remark concept of plato becaus ungreek and also veri differ from anyth which exist at all in hi ag of the world is the transposit of rank in the spartan state there had been enfranchis of helot and degrad of citizen under special circumst and in the ancient greek aristocraci merit wa certainli recogn as on of the element on which govern wa base the founder of state were suppos to be their benefactor who were rais by their great action abov the ordinari level of human at a later period the servic of warrior and legisl were held to entitl them and their descend to the privileg of citizenship and to the first rank in the state and although the exist of an ideal aristocraci is slenderli proven from the remain of earli greek histori and we have a difficulti in ascrib such a charact howev the idea mai be defin to ani actual hellen stateor inde to ani state which ha ever exist in the worldstil the rule of the best wa certainli the aspir of philosoph who probabl accommod a good deal their view of primit histori to their own notion of good govern plato further insist on appli to the guardian of hi state a seri of test by which all those who fell short of a fix standard were either remov from the govern bodi or not admit to it and thi academ disciplin did to a certain extent prevail in greek state especi in sparta he also indic that the system of cast which exist in a great part of the ancient and is by no mean extinct in the modern european world should be set asid from time to time in favour of merit he is awar how deepli the greater part of mankind resent ani interfer with the order of societi and therefor he propos hi novel idea in the form of what he himself call a monstrou fiction compar the ceremoni of prepar for the two great wave in book v two principl ar indic by him first that there is a distinct of rank depend on circumst prior to the individu second that thi distinct is and ought to be broken through by person qualiti he adapt mytholog like the homer poem to the want of the state make the phoenician tale the vehicl of hi idea everi greek state had a myth respect it own origin the platon republ mai also have a tale of earthborn men the graviti and verisimilitud with which the tale is told and the analog of greek tradit ar a suffici verif of the monstrou falsehood ancient poetri had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and iron ag succeed on anoth but plato suppos these differ in the natur of men to exist togeth in a singl state mytholog suppli a figur under which the lesson mai be taught as protagora sai the myth is more interest and also enabl plato to touch lightli on new principl without go into detail in thi passag he shadow forth a gener truth but he doe not tell us by what step the transposit of rank is to be effect inde throughout the republ he allow the lower rank to fade into the distanc we do not know whether thei ar to carri arm and whether in the fifth book thei ar or ar not includ in the communist regul respect properti and marriag nor is there ani us in argu strictli either from a few chanc word or from the silenc of plato or in draw infer which were beyond hi vision aristotl in hi critic on the posit of the lower class doe not perceiv that the poetic creation is like the air invulner and cannot be penetr by the shaft of hi logic pol two paradox which strike the modern reader as in the highest degre fanci and ideal and which suggest to him mani reflect ar to be found in the third book of the republ first the great power of music so much beyond ani influenc which is experienc by us in modern time when the art or scienc ha been far more develop and ha found the secret of harmoni as well as of melodi secondli the indefinit and almost absolut control which the soul is suppos to exercis over the bodi in the first we suspect some degre of exagger such as we mai also observ among certain master of the art not unknown to us at the present dai with thi natur enthusiasm which is felt by a few onli there seem to mingl in plato a sort of pythagorean rever for number and numer proport to which aristotl is a stranger interv of sound and number ar to him sacr thing which have a law of their own not depend on the variat of sens thei rise abov sens and becom a connect link with the world of idea but it is evid that plato is describ what to him appear to be also a fact the power of a simpl and characterist melodi on the impress mind of the greek is more than we can easili appreci the effect of nation air mai bear some comparison with it and besid all thi there is a confus between the harmoni of music note and the harmoni of soul and bodi which is so potent inspir by them the second paradox lead up to some curiou and interest questionshow far can the mind control the bodi is the relat between them on of mutual antagon or of mutual harmoni ar thei two or on and is either of them the caus of the other mai we not at time drop the opposit between them and the mode of describ them which is so familiar to us and yet hardli convei ani precis mean and try to view thi composit creatur man in a more simpl manner must we not at ani rate admit that there is in human natur a higher and a lower principl divid by no distinct line which at time break asund and take up arm against on anoth or again thei ar reconcil and move togeth either unconsci in the ordinari work of life or conscious in the pursuit of some nobl aim to be attain not without an effort and for which everi thought and nerv ar strain and then the bodi becom the good friend or alli or servant or instrument of the mind and the mind ha often a wonder and almost superhuman power of banish diseas and weak and call out a hidden strength reason and the desir the intellect and the sens ar brought into harmoni and obedi so as to form a singl human be thei ar ever part ever meet and the ident or divers of their tendenc or oper is for the most part unnot by us when the mind touch the bodi through the appetit we acknowledg the respons of the on to the other there is a tendenc in us which sai drink there is anoth which sai do not drink it is not good for you and we all of us know which is the right superior we ar also respons for our health although into thi sphere there enter some element of necess which mai be beyond our control still even in the manag of health care and thought continu over mani year mai make us almost free agent if we do not exact too much of ourselv and if we acknowledg that all human freedom is limit by the law of natur and of mind we ar disappoint to find that plato in the gener condemn which he pass on the practic of medicin prevail in hi own dai depreci the effect of diet he would like to have diseas of a definit charact and capabl of receiv a definit treatment he is afraid of invalid interf with the busi of life he doe not recogn that time is the great healer both of mental and bodili disord and that remedi which ar gradual and proce littl by littl ar safer than those which produc a sudden catastroph neither doe he see that there is no wai in which the mind can more sure influenc the bodi than by the control of eat and drink or ani other action or occas of human life on which the higher freedom of the will can be more simpl or truli assert lesser matter of style mai be remark the affect ignor of music which is plato wai of express that he is pass lightli over the subject the tent manner in which here as in the second book he proce with the construct of the state the descript of the state sometim as a realiti and then again as a work of imagin onli these ar the art by which he sustain the reader interest connect link or the prepar for the entir expuls of the poet in book x the companion pictur of the lover of litig and the valetudinarian the satir jest about the maxim of phocylid the manner in which the imag of the gold and silver citizen is taken up into the subject and the argument from the practic of asclepiu should not escap notic book iv adeimantu said suppos a person to argu socrat that you make your citizen miser and thi by their own freewil thei ar the lord of the citi and yet instead of have like other men land and hous and monei of their own thei live as mercenari and ar alwai mount guard you mai add i repli that thei receiv no pai but onli their food and have no monei to spend on a journei or a mistress well and what answer do you give my answer is that our guardian mai or mai not be the happiest of meni should not be surpris to find in the longrun that thei werebut thi is not the aim of our constitut which wa design for the good of the whole and not of ani on part if i went to a sculptor and blame him for have paint the ey which is the noblest featur of the face not purpl but black he would repli the ey must be an ey and you should look at the statu as a whole now i can well imagin a fool paradis in which everybodi is eat and drink cloth in purpl and fine linen and potter lie on sofa and have their wheel at hand that thei mai work a littl when thei pleas and cobbler and all the other class of a state lose their distinct charact and a state mai get on without cobbler but when the guardian degener into boon companion then the ruin is complet rememb that we ar not talk of peasant keep holidai but of a state in which everi man is expect to do hi own work the happi resid not in thi or that class but in the state as a whole i have anoth remark to makea middl condit is best for artisan thei should have monei enough to bui tool and not enough to be independ of busi and will not the same condit be best for our citizen if thei ar poor thei will be mean if rich luxuri and lazi and in neither case content but then how will our poor citi be abl to go to war against an enemi who ha monei there mai be a difficulti in fight against on enemi against two there will be none in the first place the contest will be carri on by train warrior against welltodo citizen and is not a regular athlet an easi match for two stout oppon at least suppos also that befor engag we send ambassador to on of the two citi sai silver and gold we have not do you help us and take our share of the spoilwho would fight against the lean wiri dog when thei might join with them in prei upon the fat sheep but if mani state join their resourc shall we not be in danger i am amus to hear you us the word state of ani but our own state thei ar state but not a statemani in on for in everi state there ar two hostil nation rich and poor which you mai set on against the other but our state while she remain true to her principl will be in veri deed the mightiest of hellen state to the size of the state there is no limit but the necess of uniti it must be neither too larg nor too small to be on thi is a matter of secondari import like the principl of transposit which wa intim in the parabl of the earthborn men the mean there impli wa that everi man should do that for which he wa fit and be at on with himself and then the whole citi would be unit but all these thing ar secondari if educ which is the great matter be duli regard when the wheel ha onc been set in motion the speed is alwai increas and each gener improv upon the preced both in physic and moral qualiti the care of the governor should be direct to preserv music and gymnast from innov alter the song of a countri damon sai and you will soon end by alter it law the chang appear innoc at first and begin in plai but the evil soon becom seriou work secretli upon the charact of individu then upon social and commerci relat and lastli upon the institut of a state and there is ruin and confus everywher but if educ remain in the establish form there will be no danger a restor process will be alwai go on the spirit of law and order will rais up what ha fallen down nor will ani regul be need for the lesser matter of liferul of deport or fashion of dress like invit like for good or for evil educ will correct defici and suppli the power of selfgovern far be it from us to enter into the particular of legisl let the guardian take care of educ and educ will take care of all other thing but without educ thei mai patch and mend as thei pleas thei will make no progress ani more than a patient who think to cure himself by some favourit remedi and will not give up hi luxuri mode of live if you tell such person that thei must first alter their habit then thei grow angri thei ar charm peopl charmingnai the veri revers evid these gentlemen ar not in your good grace nor the state which is like them and such state there ar which first ordain under penalti of death that no on shall alter the constitut and then suffer themselv to be flatter into and out of anyth and he who indulg them and fawn upon them is their leader and saviour ye the men ar as bad as the state but do you not admir their clever nai some of them ar stupid enough to believ what the peopl tell them and when all the world is tell a man that he is six feet high and he ha no measur how can he believ anyth els but dont get into a passion to see our statesmen try their nostrum and fanci that thei can cut off at a blow the hydralik rogueri of mankind is as good as a plai minut enact ar superflu in good state and ar useless in bad on and now what remain of the work of legisl noth for us but to apollo the god of delphi we leav the order of the greatest of all thingsthat is to sai religion onli our ancestr deiti sit upon the centr and navel of the earth will be trust by us if we have ani sens in an affair of such magnitud no foreign god shall be suprem in our realm here as socrat would sai let us reflect on greek what ha preced thu far we have spoken not of the happi of the citizen but onli of the wellb of the state thei mai be the happiest of men but our princip aim in found the state wa not to make them happi thei were to be guardian not holidaymak in thi pleasant manner is present to us the famou question both of ancient and modern philosophi touch the relat of duti to happi of right to util first duti then happi is the natur order of our moral idea the utilitarian principl is valuabl as a correct of error and show to us a side of ethic which is apt to be neglect it mai be admit further that right and util ar coextens and that he who make the happi of mankind hi object ha on of the highest and noblest motiv of human action but util is not the histor basi of moral nor the aspect in which moral and religi idea commonli occur to the mind the greatest happi of all is as we believ the faroff result of the divin govern of the univers the greatest happi of the individu is certainli to be found in a life of virtu and good but we seem to be more assur of a law of right than we can be of a divin purpos that all mankind should be save and we infer the on from the other and the greatest happi of the individu mai be the revers of the greatest happi in the ordinari sens of the term and mai be realis in a life of pain or in a voluntari death further the word happi ha sever ambigu it mai mean either pleasur or an ideal life happi subject or object in thi world or in anoth of ourselv onli or of our neighbour and of all men everywher by the modern founder of utilitarian the selfregard and disinterest motiv of action ar includ under the same term although thei ar commonli oppos by us as benevol and selflov the word happi ha not the definit or the sacred of truth and right it doe not equal appeal to our higher natur and ha not sunk into the conscienc of mankind it is associ too much with the comfort and conveni of life too littl with the good of the soul which we desir for their own sake in a great trial or danger or temptat or in ani great and heroic action it is scarc thought of for these reason the greatest happi principl is not the true foundat of ethic but though not the first principl it is the second which is like unto it and is often of easier applic for the larger part of human action ar neither right nor wrong except in so far as thei tend to the happi of mankind introd to gorgia and philebu the same question reappear in polit where the us or expedi seem to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater author for concern polit measur we chiefli ask how will thei affect the happi of mankind yet here too we mai observ that what we term expedi is mere the law of right limit by the condit of human societi right and truth ar the highest aim of govern as well as of individu and we ought not to lose sight of them becaus we cannot directli enforc them thei appeal to the better mind of nation and sometim thei ar too much for mere tempor interest to resist thei ar the watchword which all men us in matter of public polici as well as in their privat deal the peac of europ mai be said to depend upon them in the most commerci and utilitarian state of societi the power of idea remain and all the higher class of statesmen have in them someth of that ideal which pericl is said to have gather from the teach of anaxagora thei recognis that the true leader of men must be abov the motiv of ambit and that nation charact is of greater valu than materi comfort and prosper and thi is the order of thought in plato first he expect hi citizen to do their duti and then under favour circumst that is to sai in a wellord state their happi is assur that he wa far from exclud the modern principl of util in polit is suffici evid from other passag in which the most benefici is affirm to be the most honour and also the most sacr we mai note the manner in which the object of adeimantu here is design to draw out and deepen the argument of socrat the concept of a whole as ly at the foundat both of polit and of art in the latter suppli the onli principl of critic which under the variou name of harmoni symmetri measur proport uniti the greek seem to have appli to work of art the requir that the state should be limit in size after the tradit model of a greek state as in the polit of aristotl the fact that the citi of hella were small is convert into a principl the humor pictur of the lean dog and the fat sheep of the light activ boxer upset two stout gentlemen at least of the charm patient who ar alwai make themselv wors or again the play assumpt that there is no state but our own or the grave ironi with which the statesman is excus who believ that he is six feet high becaus he is told so and have noth to measur with is to be pardon for hi ignoranceh is too amus for us to be serious angri with him the light and superfici manner in which religion is pass over when provis ha been made for two great principlesfirst that religion shall be base on the highest concept of the god secondli that the true nation or hellen type shall be maintain socrat proce but where amid all thi is justic son of ariston tell me where light a candl and search the citi and get your brother and the rest of our friend to help in seek for her that wont do repli glaucon you yourself promis to make the search and talk about the impieti of desert justic well i said i will lead the wai but do you follow my notion is that our state be perfect will contain all the four virtueswisdom courag temper justic if we elimin the three first the unknown remaind will be justic first then of wisdom the state which we have call into be will be wise becaus polit and polici is on among mani kind of skillnot the skill of the carpent or of the worker in metal or of the husbandman but the skill of him who advis about the interest of the whole state of such a kind is the skill of the guardian who ar a small class in number far smaller than the blacksmith but in them is concentr the wisdom of the state and if thi small rule class have wisdom then the whole state will be wise our second virtu is courag which we have no difficulti in find in anoth classthat of soldier courag mai be defin as a sort of salvationth neverfail salvat of the opinion which law and educ have prescrib concern danger you know the wai in which dyer first prepar the white ground and then lai on the dye of purpl or of ani other colour colour dy in thi wai becom fix and no soap or lye will ever wash them out now the ground is educ and the law ar the colour and if the ground is properli laid neither the soap of pleasur nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out thi power which preserv right opinion about danger i would ask you to call courag ad the epithet polit or civil in order to distinguish it from mere anim courag and from a higher courag which mai hereaft be discuss two virtu remain temper and justic more than the preced virtu temper suggest the idea of harmoni some light is thrown upon the natur of thi virtu by the popular descript of a man as master of himselfwhich ha an absurd sound becaus the master is also the servant the express realli mean that the better principl in a man master the wors there ar in citi whole classeswomen slave and the likewho correspond to the wors and a few onli to the better and in our state the former class ar held under control by the latter now to which of these class doe temper belong to both of them and our state if ani will be the abod of temper and we were right in describ thi virtu as a harmoni which is diffus through the whole make the dweller in the citi to be of on mind and attun the upper and middl and lower class like the string of an instrument whether you suppos them to differ in wisdom strength or wealth and now we ar near the spot let us draw in and surround the cover and watch with all our ey lest justic should slip awai and escap tell me if you see the thicket move first nai i would have you lead well then offer up a prayer and follow the wai is dark and difficult but we must push on i begin to see a track good new why glaucon our dul of scent is quit ludicr while we ar strain our ey into the distanc justic is tumbl out at our feet we ar as bad as peopl look for a thing which thei have in their hand have you forgotten our old principl of the divis of labour or of everi man do hi own busi concern which we spoke at the foundat of the statewhat but thi wa justic is there ani other virtu remain which can compet with wisdom and temper and courag in the scale of polit virtu for everi on have hi own is the great object of govern and the great object of trade is that everi man should do hi own busi not that there is much harm in a carpent try to be a cobbler or a cobbler transform himself into a carpent but great evil mai aris from the cobbler leav hi last and turn into a guardian or legisl or when a singl individu is trainer warrior legisl all in on and thi evil is injustic or everi man do anoth busi i do not sai that as yet we ar in a condit to arriv at a final conclus for the definit which we believ to hold good in state ha still to be test by the individu have read the larg letter we will now come back to the small from the two togeth a brilliant light mai be struck out socrat proce to discov the natur of justic by a method of residu each of the first three virtu correspond to on of the three part of the soul and on of the three class in the state although the third temper ha more of the natur of a harmoni than the first two if there be a fourth virtu that can onli be sought for in the relat of the three part in the soul or class in the state to on anoth it is obviou and simpl and for that veri reason ha not been found out the modern logician will be inclin to object that idea cannot be separ like chemic substanc but that thei run into on anoth and mai be onli differ aspect or name of the same thing and such in thi instanc appear to be the case for the definit here given of justic is verbal the same as on of the definit of temper given by socrat in the charmid which howev is onli provision and is afterward reject and so far from justic remain over when the other virtu ar elimin the justic and temper of the republ can with difficulti be distinguish temper appear to be the virtu of a part onli and on of three wherea justic is a univers virtu of the whole soul yet on the other hand temper is also describ as a sort of harmoni and in thi respect is akin to justic justic seem to differ from temper in degre rather than in kind wherea temper is the harmoni of discord element justic is the perfect order by which all natur and class do their own busi the right man in the right place the divis and cooper of all the citizen justic again is a more abstract notion than the other virtu and therefor from plato point of view the foundat of them to which thei ar refer and which in idea preced them the propos to omit temper is a mere trick of style intend to avoid monotoni there is a famou question discuss in on of the earlier dialogu of plato protagora arist nic ethic whether the virtu ar on or mani thi receiv an answer which is to the effect that there ar four cardin virtu now for the first time brought togeth in ethic philosophi and on suprem over the rest which is not like aristotl concept of univers justic virtu rel to other but the whole of virtu rel to the part to thi univers concept of justic or order in the first educ and in the moral natur of man the still more univers concept of the good in the second educ and in the sphere of specul knowledg seem to succe both might be equal describ by the term law order harmoni but while the idea of good embrac all time and all exist the concept of justic is not extend beyond man socrat is now go to identifi the individu and the state but first he must prove that there ar three part of the individu soul hi argument is as followsquant make no differ in qualiti the word just whether appli to the individu or to the state ha the same mean and the term justic impli that the same three principl in the state and in the individu were do their own busi but ar thei realli three or on the question is difficult and on which can hardli be solv by the method which we ar now us but the truer and longer wai would take up too much of our time the shorter will satisfi me well then you would admit that the qualiti of state mean the qualiti of the individu who compos them the scythian and thracian ar passion our own race intellectu and the egyptian and phoenician covet becaus the individu member of each have such and such a charact the difficulti is to determin whether the sever principl ar on or three whether that is to sai we reason with on part of our natur desir with anoth ar angri with anoth or whether the whole soul come into plai in each sort of action thi enquiri howev requir a veri exact definit of term the same thing in the same relat cannot be affect in two opposit wai but there is no imposs in a man stand still yet move hi arm or in a top which is fix on on spot go round upon it axi there is no necess to mention all the possibl except let us provision assum that opposit cannot do or be or suffer opposit in the same relat and to the class of opposit belong assent and dissent desir and avoid and on form of desir is thirst and hunger and here aris a new pointthirst is thirst of drink hunger is hunger of food not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food with the singl except of cours that the veri fact of our desir anyth impli that it is good when rel term have no attribut their correl have no attribut when thei have attribut their correl also have them for exampl the term greater is simpli rel to less and knowledg refer to a subject of knowledg but on the other hand a particular knowledg is of a particular subject again everi scienc ha a distinct charact which is defin by an object medicin for exampl is the scienc of health although not to be confound with health have clear our idea thu far let us return to the origin instanc of thirst which ha a definit objectdrink now the thirsti soul mai feel two distinct impuls the anim on sai drink the ration on which sai do not drink the two impuls ar contradictori and therefor we mai assum that thei spring from distinct principl in the soul but is passion a third principl or akin to desir there is a stori of a certain leontiu which throw some light on thi question he wa come up from the piraeu outsid the north wall and he pass a spot where there were dead bodi ly by the execution he felt a long desir to see them and also an abhorr of them at first he turn awai and shut hi ey then suddenli tear them open he saidtak your fill ye wretch of the fair sight now is there not here a third principl which is often found to come to the assist of reason against desir but never of desir against reason thi is passion or spirit of the separ exist of which we mai further convinc ourselv by put the follow casewhen a man suffer justli if he be of a gener natur he is not indign at the hardship which he undergo but when he suffer unjustli hi indign is hi great support hunger and thirst cannot tame him the spirit within him must do or die until the voic of the shepherd that is of reason bid hi dog bark no more is heard within thi show that passion is the alli of reason is passion then the same with reason no for the former exist in children and brute and homer afford a proof of the distinct between them when he sai he smote hi breast and thu rebuk hi soul and now at last we have reach firm ground and ar abl to infer that the virtu of the state and of the individu ar the same for wisdom and courag and justic in the state ar sever the wisdom and courag and justic in the individu who form the state each of the three class will do the work of it own class in the state and each part in the individu soul reason the superior and passion the inferior will be harmon by the influenc of music and gymnast the counsellor and the warrior the head and the arm will act togeth in the town of mansoul and keep the desir in proper subject the courag of the warrior is that qualiti which preserv a right opinion about danger in spite of pleasur and pain the wisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which ha author and reason the virtu of temper is the friendship of the rule and the subject principl both in the state and in the individu of justic we have alreadi spoken and the notion alreadi given of it mai be confirm by common instanc will the just state or the just individu steal lie commit adulteri or be guilti of impieti to god and men no and is not the reason of thi that the sever principl whether in the state or in the individu do their own busi and justic is the qualiti which make just men and just state moreov our old divis of labour which requir that there should be on man for on us wa a dream or anticip of what wa to follow and that dream ha now been realiz in justic which begin by bind togeth the three chord of the soul and then act harmoni in everi relat of life and injustic which is the insubordin and disobedi of the inferior element in the soul is the opposit of justic and is inharmoni and unnatur be to the soul what diseas is to the bodi for in the soul as well as in the bodi good or bad action produc good or bad habit and virtu is the health and beauti and wellb of the soul and vice is the diseas and weak and deform of the soul again the old question return upon us is justic or injustic the more profit the question ha becom ridicul for injustic like mortal diseas make life not worth have come up with me to the hill which overhang the citi and look down upon the singl form of virtu and the infinit form of vice among which ar four special on characterist both of state and of individu and the state which correspond to the singl form of virtu is that which we have been describ wherein reason rule under on of two namesmonarchi and aristocraci thu there ar five form in all both of state and of soul in attempt to prove that the soul ha three separ faculti plato take occas to discuss what make differ of faculti and the criterion which he propos is differ in the work of the faculti the same faculti cannot produc contradictori effect but the path of earli reason is beset by thorni entangl and he will not proce a step without first clear the ground thi lead him into a tiresom digress which is intend to explain the natur of contradict first the contradict must be at the same time and in the same relat secondli no extran word must be introduc into either of the term in which the contradictori proposit is express for exampl thirst is of drink not of warm drink he impli what he doe not sai that if by the advic of reason or by the impuls of anger a man is restrain from drink thi prove that thirst or desir under which thirst is includ is distinct from anger and reason but suppos that we allow the term thirst or desir to be modifi and sai an angri thirst or a reveng desir then the two sphere of desir and anger overlap and becom confus thi case therefor ha to be exclud and still there remain an except to the rule in the us of the term good which is alwai impli in the object of desir these ar the discuss of an ag befor logic and ani on who is weari by them should rememb that thei ar necessari to the clear up of idea in the first develop of the human faculti the psycholog of plato extend no further than the divis of the soul into the ration irasc and concupisc element which as far as we know wa first made by him and ha been retain by aristotl and succeed ethic writer the chief difficulti in thi earli analysi of the mind is to defin exactli the place of the irasc faculti greek which mai be various describ under the term righteou indign spirit passion it is the foundat of courag which includ in plato moral courag the courag of endur pain and of surmount intellectu difficulti as well as of meet danger in war though irrat it inclin to side with the ration it cannot be arous by punish when justli inflict it sometim take the form of an enthusiasm which sustain a man in the perform of great action it is the lion heart with which the reason make a treati on the other hand it is neg rather than posit it is indign at wrong or falsehood but doe not like love in the symposium and phaedru aspir to the vision of truth or good it is the peremptori militari spirit which prevail in the govern of honour it differ from anger greek thi latter term have no accessori notion of righteou indign although aristotl ha retain the word yet we mai observ that passion greek ha with him lost it affin to the ration and ha becom indistinguish from anger greek and to thi vernacular us plato himself in the law seem to revert though not alwai by modern philosophi too as well as in our ordinari convers the word anger or passion ar emploi almost exclus in a bad sens there is no connot of a just or reason caus by which thei ar arous the feel of righteou indign is too partial and accident to admit of our regard it as a separ virtu or habit we ar tempt also to doubt whether plato is right in suppos that an offend howev justli condemn could be expect to acknowledg the justic of hi sentenc thi is the spirit of a philosoph or martyr rather than of a crimin we mai observ how nearli plato approach aristotl famou thesi that good action produc good habit the word as healthi practic greek produc health so do just practic produc justic have a sound veri like the nicomachean ethic but we note also that an incident remark in plato ha becom a farreach principl in aristotl and an insepar part of a great ethic system there is a difficulti in understand what plato meant by the longer wai he seem to intim some metaphys of the futur which will not be satisfi with argu from the principl of contradict in the sixth and seventh book compar sophist and parmenid he ha given us a sketch of such a metaphys but when glaucon ask for the final revel of the idea of good he is put off with the declar that he ha not yet studi the preliminari scienc how he would have fill up the sketch or argu about such question from a higher point of view we can onli conjectur perhap he hope to find some a priori method of develop the part out of the whole or he might have ask which of the idea contain the other idea and possibl have stumbl on the hegelian ident of the ego and the univers or he mai have imagin that idea might be construct in some manner analog to the construct of figur and number in the mathemat scienc the most certain and necessari truth wa to plato the univers and to thi he wa alwai seek to refer all knowledg or opinion just as in modern time we seek to rest them on the opposit pole of induct and experi the aspir of metaphysician have alwai tend to pass beyond the limit of human thought and languag thei seem to have reach a height at which thei ar move about in world unreal and their concept although profoundli affect their own mind becom invis or unintellig to other we ar not therefor surpriz to find that plato himself ha nowher clearli explain hi doctrin of idea or that hi school in a later gener like hi contemporari glaucon and adeimantu were unabl to follow him in thi region of specul in the sophist where he is refut the sceptic which maintain either that there wa no such thing as predic or that all might be predic of all he arriv at the conclus that some idea combin with some but not all with all but he make onli on or two step forward on thi path he nowher attain to ani connect system of idea or even to a knowledg of the most elementari relat of the scienc to on anoth book v i wa go to enumer the four form of vice or declin in state when polemarchush wa sit a littl farther from me than adeimantustak him by the coat and lean toward him said someth in an underton of which i onli caught the word shall we let him off certainli not said adeimantu rais hi voic whom i said ar you not go to let off you he said why becaus we think that you ar not deal fairli with us in omit women and children of whom you have slili dispos under the gener formula that friend have all thing in common and wa i not right ye he repli but there ar mani sort of commun or commun and we want to know which of them is right the compani as you have just heard ar resolv to have a further explan thrasymachu said do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold or to hear you discours ye i said but the discours should be of a reason length glaucon ad ye socrat and there is reason in spend the whole of life in such discuss but prai without more ado tell us how thi commun is to be carri out and how the interv between birth and educ is to be fill up well i said the subject ha sever difficultieswhat is possibl is the first question what is desir is the second fear not he repli for you ar speak among friend that i repli is a sorri consol i shall destroi my friend as well as myself not that i mind a littl innoc laughter but he who kill the truth is a murder then said glaucon laugh in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiv us socrat proceedsth guardian of our state ar to be watchdog as we have alreadi said now dog ar not divid into he and shesw do not take the masculin gender out to hunt and leav the femal at home to look after their puppi thei have the same employmentsth onli differ between them is that the on sex is stronger and the other weaker but if women ar to have the same employ as men thei must have the same educationthei must be taught music and gymnast and the art of war i know that a great joke will be made of their ride on horseback and carri weapon the sight of the nake old wrinkl women show their agil in the palaestra will certainli not be a vision of beauti and mai be expect to becom a famou jest but we must not mind the wit there wa a time when thei might have laugh at our present gymnast all is habit peopl have at last found out that the exposur is better than the conceal of the person and now thei laugh no more evil onli should be the subject of ridicul the first question is whether women ar abl either wholli or partial to share in the employ of men and here we mai be charg with inconsist in make the propos at all for we start origin with the divis of labour and the divers of employ wa base on the differ of natur but is there no differ between men and women nai ar thei not wholli differ there wa the difficulti glaucon which made me unwil to speak of famili relat howev when a man is out of hi depth whether in a pool or in an ocean he can onli swim for hi life and we must try to find a wai of escap if we can the argument is that differ natur have differ us and the natur of men and women ar said to differ but thi is onli a verbal opposit we do not consid that the differ mai be pure nomin and accident for exampl a bald man and a hairi man ar oppos in a singl point of view but you cannot infer that becaus a bald man is a cobbler a hairi man ought not to be a cobbler now why is such an infer erron simpli becaus the opposit between them is partial onli like the differ between a male physician and a femal physician not run through the whole natur like the differ between a physician and a carpent and if the differ of the sex is onli that the on beget and the other bear children thi doe not prove that thei ought to have distinct educ admit that women differ from men in capac do not men equal differ from on anoth ha not natur scatter all the qualiti which our citizen requir indiffer up and down among the two sex and even in their peculiar pursuit ar not women often though in some case superior to men ridicul enough surpass by them women ar the same in kind as men and have the same aptitud or want of aptitud for medicin or gymnast or war but in a less degre on woman will be a good guardian anoth not and the good must be chosen to be the colleagu of our guardian if howev their natur ar the same the infer is that their educ must also be the same there is no longer anyth unnatur or imposs in a woman learn music and gymnast and the educ which we give them will be the veri best far superior to that of cobbler and will train up the veri best women and noth can be more advantag to the state than thi therefor let them strip cloth in their chastiti and share in the toil of war and in the defenc of their countri he who laugh at them is a fool for hi pain the first wave is past and the argument is compel to admit that men and women have common duti and pursuit a second and greater wave is roll incommun of wive and children is thi either expedi or possibl the expedi i do not doubt i am not so sure of the possibl nai i think that a consider doubt will be entertain on both point i meant to have escap the troubl of prove the first but as you have detect the littl stratagem i must even submit onli allow me to feed my fanci like the solitari in hi walk with a dream of what might be and then i will return to the question of what can be in the first place our ruler will enforc the law and make new on where thei ar want and their alli or minist will obei you as legisl have alreadi select the men and now you shall select the women after the select ha been made thei will dwell in common hous and have their meal in common and will be brought togeth by a necess more certain than that of mathemat but thei cannot be allow to live in licenti that is an unholi thing which the ruler ar determin to prevent for the avoid of thi holi marriag festiv will be institut and their holi will be in proport to their us and here glaucon i should like to ask as i know that you ar a breeder of bird and anim do you not take the greatest care in the mate certainli and there is no reason to suppos that less care is requir in the marriag of human be but then our ruler must be skil physician of the state for thei will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desir union between their subject the good must be pair with the good and the bad with the bad and the offspr of the on must be rear and of the other destroi in thi wai the flock will be preserv in prime condit hymen festiv will be celebr at time fix with an ey to popul and the bride and bridegroom will meet at them and by an ingeni system of lot the ruler will contriv that the brave and the fair come togeth and that those of inferior breed ar pair with inferiorsth latter will ascrib to chanc what is realli the invent of the ruler and when children ar born the offspr of the brave and fair will be carri to an enclosur in a certain part of the citi and there attend by suitabl nurs the rest will be hurri awai to place unknown the mother will be brought to the fold and will suckl the children care howev must be taken that none of them recognis their own offspr and if necessari other nurs mai also be hire the troubl of watch and get up at night will be transfer to attend then the wive of our guardian will have a fine easi time when thei ar have children and quit right too i said that thei should the parent ought to be in the prime of life which for a man mai be reckon at thirti yearsfrom twentyf when he ha pass the point at which the speed of life is greatest to fiftyf and at twenti year for a womanfrom twenti to forti ani on abov or below those ag who partak in the hymen shall be guilti of impieti also everi on who form a marriag connexion at other time without the consent of the ruler thi latter regul appli to those who ar within the specifi ag after which thei mai rang at will provid thei avoid the prohibit degre of parent and children or of brother and sister which last howev ar not absolut prohibit if a dispens be procur but how shall we know the degre of affin when all thing ar common the answer is that brother and sister ar all such as ar born seven or nine month after the espous and their parent those who ar then espous and everi on will have mani children and everi child mani parent socrat proce i have now to prove that thi scheme is advantag and also consist with our entir politi the greatest good of a state is uniti the greatest evil discord and distract and there will be uniti where there ar no privat pleasur or pain or interestswher if on member suffer all the member suffer if on citizen is touch all ar quickli sensit and the least hurt to the littl finger of the state run through the whole bodi and vibrat to the soul for the true state like an individu is injur as a whole when ani part is affect everi state ha subject and ruler who in a democraci ar call ruler and in other state master but in our state thei ar call saviour and alli and the subject who in other state ar term slave ar by us term nurtur and paymast and those who ar term comrad and colleagu in other place ar by us call father and brother and wherea in other state member of the same govern regard on of their colleagu as a friend and anoth as an enemi in our state no man is a stranger to anoth for everi citizen is connect with everi other by ti of blood and these name and thi wai of speak will have a correspond realitybroth father sister mother repeat from infanc in the ear of children will not be mere word then again the citizen will have all thing in common in have common properti thei will have common pleasur and pain can there be strife and content among those who ar of on mind or lawsuit about properti when men have noth but their bodi which thei call their own or suit about violenc when everi on is bound to defend himself the permiss to strike when insult will be an antidot to the knife and will prevent disturb in the state but no younger man will strike an elder rever will prevent him from lai hand on hi kindr and he will fear that the rest of the famili mai retali moreov our citizen will be rid of the lesser evil of life there will be no flatteri of the rich no sordid household care no borrow and not pai compar with the citizen of other state our will be olymp victor and crown with bless greater stillthei and their children have a better mainten dure life and after death an honour burial nor ha the happi of the individu been sacrif to the happi of the state our olymp victor ha not been turn into a cobbler but he ha a happi beyond that of ani cobbler at the same time if ani conceit youth begin to dream of appropri the state to himself he must be remind that half is better than the whole i should certainli advis him to stai where he is when he ha the promis of such a brave life but is such a commun possiblea among the anim so also among men and if possibl in what wai possibl about war there is no difficulti the principl of commun is adapt to militari servic parent will take their children to look on at a battl just as potter boi ar train to the busi by look on at the wheel and to the parent themselv as to other anim the sight of their young on will prove a great incent to braveri young warrior must learn but thei must not run into danger although a certain degre of risk is worth incur when the benefit is great the young creatur should be place under the care of experienc veteran and thei should have wingsthat is to sai swift and tractabl steed on which thei mai fly awai and escap on of the first thing to be done is to teach a youth to ride coward and desert shall be degrad to the class of husbandmen gentlemen who allow themselv to be taken prison mai be present to the enemi but what shall be done to the hero first of all he shall be crown by all the youth in the armi secondli he shall receiv the right hand of fellowship and thirdli do you think that there is ani harm in hi be kiss we have alreadi determin that he shall have more wive than other in order that he mai have as mani children as possibl and at a feast he shall have more to eat we have the author of homer for honour brave men with long chine which is an appropri compliment becaus meat is a veri strengthen thing fill the bowl then and give the best seat and meat to the bravemai thei do them good and he who di in battl will be at onc declar to be of the golden race and will as we believ becom on of hesiod guardian angel he shall be worship after death in the manner prescrib by the oracl and not onli he but all other benefactor of the state who die in ani other wai shall be admit to the same honour the next question is how shall we treat our enemi shall hellen be enslav no for there is too great a risk of the whole race pass under the yoke of the barbarian or shall the dead be despoil certainli not for that sort of thing is an excus for skulk and ha been the ruin of mani an armi there is mean and feminin malic in make an enemi of the dead bodi when the soul which wa the owner ha fledlik a dog who cannot reach hi assail and quarrel with the stone which ar thrown at him instead again the arm of hellen should not be offer up in the templ of the god thei ar a pollut for thei ar taken from brethren and on similar ground there should be a limit to the devast of hellen territoryth hous should not be burnt nor more than the annual produc carri off for war is of two kind civil and foreign the first of which is properli term discord and onli the second war and war between hellen is in realiti civil wara quarrel in a famili which is ever to be regard as unpatriot and unnatur and ought to be prosecut with a view to reconcili in a true philhellen spirit as of those who would chasten but not utterli enslav the war is not against a whole nation who ar a friendli multitud of men women and children but onli against a few guilti person when thei ar punish peac will be restor that is the wai in which hellen should war against on anotherand against barbarian as thei war against on anoth now but my dear socrat you ar forget the main question is such a state possibl i grant all and more than you sai about the blessed of be on familyfath brother mother daughter go out to war togeth but i want to ascertain the possibl of thi ideal state you ar too unmerci the first wave and the second wave i have hardli escap and now you will certainli drown me with the third when you see the tower crest of the wave i expect you to take piti not a whit well then we were led to form our ideal politi in the search after justic and the just man answer to the just state is thi ideal at all the wors for be impractic would the pictur of a perfectli beauti man be ani the wors becaus no such man ever live can ani realiti come up to the idea natur will not allow word to be fulli realiz but if i am to try and realiz the ideal of the state in a measur i think that an approach mai be made to the perfect of which i dream by on or two i do not sai slight but possibl chang in the present constitut of state i would reduc them to a singl oneth great wave as i call it until then king ar philosoph or philosoph ar king citi will never ceas from ill no nor the human race nor will our ideal politi ever come into be i know that thi is a hard sai which few will be abl to receiv socrat all the world will take off hi coat and rush upon you with stick and stone and therefor i would advis you to prepar an answer you got me into the scrape i said and i wa right he repli howev i will stand by you as a sort of donoth wellmean alli have the help of such a champion i will do my best to maintain my posit and first i must explain of whom i speak and what sort of natur these ar who ar to be philosoph and ruler as you ar a man of pleasur you will not have forgotten how indiscrimin lover ar in their attach thei love all and turn blemish into beauti the snubnos youth is said to have a win grace the beak of anoth ha a royal look the featureless ar faultless the dark ar manli the fair angel the sickli have a new term of endear invent expressli for them which is honeypal lover of wine and lover of ambit also desir the object of their affect in everi form now here come the pointth philosoph too is a lover of knowledg in everi form he ha an insati curios but will curios make a philosoph ar the lover of sight and sound who let out their ear to everi choru at the dionysiac festiv to be call philosoph thei ar not true philosoph but onli an imit then how ar we to describ the true you would acknowledg the exist of abstract idea such as justic beauti good evil which ar sever on yet in their variou combin appear to be mani those who recogn these realiti ar philosoph wherea the other class hear sound and see colour and understand their us in the art but cannot attain to the true or wake vision of absolut justic or beauti or truth thei have not the light of knowledg but of opinion and what thei see is a dream onli perhap he of whom we sai the last will be angri with us can we pacifi him without reveal the disord of hi mind suppos we sai that if he ha knowledg we rejoic to hear it but knowledg must be of someth which is as ignor is of someth which is not and there is a third thing which both is and is not and is matter of opinion onli opinion and knowledg then have distinct object must also be distinct faculti and by faculti i mean power unseen and distinguish onli by the differ in their object as opinion and knowledg differ sinc the on is liabl to err but the other is uner and is the mightiest of all our faculti if be is the object of knowledg and notb of ignor and these ar the extrem opinion must lie between them and mai be call darker than the on and brighter than the other thi intermedi or conting matter is and is not at the same time and partak both of exist and of nonexist now i would ask my good friend who deni abstract beauti and justic and affirm a mani beauti and a mani just whether everyth he see is not in some point of view differentth beauti ugli the piou impiou the just unjust is not the doubl also the half and ar not heavi and light rel term which pass into on anoth everyth is and is not as in the old riddlea man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a bird with a stone and not a stone the mind cannot be fix on either altern and these ambigu intermedi er halflight object which have a disorderli movement in the region between be and notb ar the proper matter of opinion as the immut object ar the proper matter of knowledg and he who grovel in the world of sens and ha onli thi uncertain percept of thing is not a philosoph but a lover of opinion onli the fifth book is the new begin of the republ in which the commun of properti and of famili ar first maintain and the transit is made to the kingdom of philosoph for both of these plato after hi manner ha been prepar in some chanc word of book iv which fall unperceiv on the reader mind as thei ar suppos at first to have fallen on the ear of glaucon and adeimantu the paradox as morgenstern term them of thi book of the republ will be reserv for anoth place a few remark on the style and some explan of difficulti mai be briefli ad first there is the imag of the wave which serv for a sort of scheme or plan of the book the first wave the second wave the third and greatest wave come roll in and we hear the roar of them all that can be said of the extravag of plato propos is anticip by himself noth is more admir than the hesit with which he propos the solemn text until king ar philosoph etc or the reaction from the sublim to the ridicul when glaucon describ the manner in which the new truth will be receiv by mankind some defect and difficulti mai be note in the execut of the communist plan noth is told us of the applic of commun to the lower class nor is the tabl of prohibit degre capabl of be made out it is quit possibl that a child born at on hymen festiv mai marri on of it own brother or sister or even on of it parent at anoth plato is afraid of incestu union but at the same time he doe not wish to bring befor us the fact that the citi would be divid into famili of those born seven and nine month after each hymen festiv if it were worth while to argu serious about such fanci we might remark that while all the old affin ar abolish the newli prohibit affin rest not on ani natur or ration principl but onli upon the accid of children have been born in the same month and year nor doe he explain how the lot could be so manipul by the legislatur as to bring togeth the fairest and best the singular express which is emploi to describ the ag of fiveandtwenti mai perhap be taken from some poet in the delin of the philosoph the illustr of the natur of philosophi deriv from love ar more suit to the apprehens of glaucon the athenian man of pleasur than to modern tast or feel thei ar partli faceti but also contain a germ of truth that scienc is a whole remain a true principl of induct as well as of metaphys philosophi and the love of univers knowledg is still the characterist of the philosoph in modern as well as in ancient time at the end of the fifth book plato introduc the figment of conting matter which ha exercis so great an influenc both on the ethic and theologi of the modern world and which occur here for the first time in the histori of philosophi he did not remark that the degre of knowledg in the subject have noth correspond to them in the object with him a word must answer to an idea and he could not conceiv of an opinion which wa an opinion about noth the influenc of analog led him to invent parallel and conjug and to overlook fact to us some of hi difficulti ar puzzl onli from their simplic we do not perceiv that the answer to them is tumbl out at our feet to the mind of earli thinker the concept of notb wa dark and mysteri thei did not see that thi terribl apparit which threaten destruct to all knowledg wa onli a logic determin the common term under which through the accident us of languag two entir differ idea were includ wa anoth sourc of confus thu through the ambigu of greek plato attempt to introduc order into the first chao of human thought seem to have confus percept and opinion and to have fail to distinguish the conting from the rel in the theaetetu the first of these difficulti begin to clear up in the sophist the second and for thi as well as for other reason both these dialogu ar probabl to be regard as later than the republ book vi have determin that the mani have no knowledg of true be and have no clear pattern in their mind of justic beauti truth and that philosoph have such pattern we have now to ask whether thei or the mani shall be ruler in our state but who can doubt that philosoph should be chosen if thei have the other qualiti which ar requir in a ruler for thei ar lover of the knowledg of the etern and of all truth thei ar hater of falsehood their meaner desir ar absorb in the interest of knowledg thei ar spectat of all time and all exist and in the magnific of their contempl the life of man is as noth to them nor is death fear also thei ar of a social graciou disposit equal free from cowardic and arrog thei learn and rememb easili thei have harmoni wellregul mind truth flow to them sweetli by natur can the god of jealousi himself find ani fault with such an assemblag of good qualiti here adeimantu interposesno man can answer you socrat but everi man feel that thi is ow to hi own defici in argument he is driven from on posit to anoth until he ha noth more to sai just as an unskil player at draught is reduc to hi last move by a more skill oppon and yet all the time he mai be right he mai know in thi veri instanc that those who make philosophi the busi of their live gener turn out rogu if thei ar bad men and fool if thei ar good what do you sai i should sai that he is quit right then how is such an admiss reconcil with the doctrin that philosoph should be king i shall answer you in a parabl which will also let you see how poor a hand i am at the invent of allegori the relat of good men to their govern is so peculiar that in order to defend them i must take an illustr from the world of fiction conceiv the captain of a ship taller by a head and shoulder than ani of the crew yet a littl deaf a littl blind and rather ignor of the seaman art the sailor want to steer although thei know noth of the art and thei have a theori that it cannot be learn if the helm is refus them thei drug the captain posset bind him hand and foot and take possess of the ship he who join in the mutini is term a good pilot and what not thei have no concept that the true pilot must observ the wind and the star and must be their master whether thei like it or notsuch an on would be call by them fool prater stargaz thi is my parabl which i will beg you to interpret for me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosoph ha such an evil name and to explain to them that not he but those who will not us him ar to blame for hi useless the philosoph should not beg of mankind to be put in author over them the wise man should not seek the rich as the proverb bid but everi man whether rich or poor must knock at the door of the physician when he ha need of him now the pilot is the philosopherh whom in the parabl thei call stargaz and the mutin sailor ar the mob of politician by whom he is render useless not that these ar the worst enemi of philosophi who is far more dishonour by her own profess son when thei ar corrupt by the world need i recal the origin imag of the philosoph did we not sai of him just now that he love truth and hate falsehood and that he could not rest in the multipl of phenomena but wa led by a sympathi in hi own natur to the contempl of the absolut all the virtu as well as truth who is the leader of them took up their abod in hi soul but as you were observ if we turn asid to view the realiti we see that the person who were thu describ with the except of a small and useless class ar utter rogu the point which ha to be consid is the origin of thi corrupt in natur everi on will admit that the philosoph in our descript of him is a rare be but what numberless caus tend to destroi these rare be there is no good thing which mai not be a caus of evilhealth wealth strength rank and the virtu themselv when place under unfavour circumst for as in the anim or veget world the strongest seed most need the accompani of good air and soil so the best of human charact turn out the worst when thei fall upon an unsuit soil wherea weak natur hardli ever do ani consider good or harm thei ar not the stuff out of which either great crimin or great hero ar made the philosoph follow the same analog he is either the best or the worst of all men some person sai that the sophist ar the corrupt of youth but is not public opinion the real sophist who is everywher presentin those veri person in the assembl in the court in the camp in the applaus and hiss of the theatr reecho by the surround hill will not a young man heart leap amid these discord sound and will ani educ save him from be carri awai by the torrent nor is thi all for if he will not yield to opinion there follow the gentl compuls of exil or death what principl of rival sophist or anybodi els can overcom in such an unequ contest charact there mai be more than human who ar exceptionsgod mai save a man but not hi own strength further i would have you consid that the hirel sophist onli give back to the world their own opinion he is the keeper of the monster who know how to flatter or anger him and observ the mean of hi inarticul grunt good is what pleas him evil what he dislik truth and beauti ar determin onli by the tast of the brute such is the sophist wisdom and such is the condit of those who make public opinion the test of truth whether in art or in moral the curs is laid upon them of be and do what it approv and when thei attempt first principl the failur is ludicr think of all thi and ask yourself whether the world is more like to be a believ in the uniti of the idea or in the multipl of phenomena and the world if not a believ in the idea cannot be a philosoph and must therefor be a persecutor of philosoph there is anoth evilth world doe not like to lose the gift natur and so thei flatter the young alcibiad into a magnific opinion of hi own capac the tall proper youth begin to expand and is dream of kingdom and empir if at thi instant a friend whisper to him now the god lighten thee thou art a great fool and must be educateddo you think that he will listen or suppos a better sort of man who is attract toward philosophi will thei not make herculean effort to spoil and corrupt him ar we not right in sai that the love of knowledg no less than rich mai divert him men of thi class critia often becom politiciansthei ar the author of great mischief in state and sometim also of great good and thu philosophi is desert by her natur protector and other enter in and dishonour her vulgar littl mind see the land open and rush from the prison of the art into her templ a clever mechan have a soul coars as hi bodi think that he will gain cast by becom her suitor for philosophi even in her fallen estat ha a digniti of her ownand he like a bald littl blacksmith apprentic as he is have made some monei and got out of duranc wash and dress himself as a bridegroom and marri hi master daughter what will be the issu of such marriag will thei not be vile and bastard devoid of truth and natur thei will small then is the remnant of genuin philosoph there mai be a few who ar citizen of small state in which polit ar not worth think of or who have been detain by theag bridl of ill health for my own case of the oracular sign is almost uniqu and too rare to be worth mention and these few when thei have tast the pleasur of philosophi and have taken a look at that den of thiev and place of wild beast which is human life will stand asid from the storm under the shelter of a wall and try to preserv their own innoc and to depart in peac a great work too will have been accomplish by them great ye but not the greatest for man is a social be and can onli attain hi highest develop in the societi which is best suit to him enough then of the caus why philosophi ha such an evil name anoth question is which of exist state is suit to her not on of them at present she is like some exot seed which degener in a strang soil onli in her proper state will she be shown to be of heavenli growth and is her proper state our or some other our in all point but on which wa left undetermin you mai rememb our sai that some live mind or wit of the legisl wa need in state but we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulti and now the question recur and ha not grown easierhow mai philosophi be safe studi let us bring her into the light of dai and make an end of the inquiri in the first place i sai boldli that noth can be wors than the present mode of studi person usual pick up a littl philosophi in earli youth and in the interv of busi but thei never master the real difficulti which is dialect later perhap thei occasion go to a lectur on philosophi year advanc and the sun of philosophi unlik that of heracleitu set never to rise again thi order of educ should be revers it should begin with gymnast in youth and as the man strengthen he should increas the gymnast of hi soul then when activ life is over let him final return to philosophi you ar in earnest socrat but the world will be equal earnest in withstand youno more than thrasymachu do not make a quarrel between thrasymachu and me who were never enemi and ar now good friend enough and i shall do my best to convinc him and all mankind of the truth of my word or at ani rate to prepar for the futur when in anoth life we mai again take part in similar discuss that will be a long time henc not long in comparison with etern the mani will probabl remain incredul for thei have never seen the natur uniti of idea but onli artifici juxtaposit not free and gener thought but trick of controversi and quip of lawa perfect man rule in a perfect state even a singl on thei have not known and we foresaw that there wa no chanc of perfect either in state or individu until a necess wa laid upon philosophersnot the rogu but those whom we call the useless classof hold offic or until the son of king were inspir with a true love of philosophi whether in the infin of past time there ha been or is in some distant land or ever will be hereaft an ideal such as we have describ we stoutli maintain that there ha been is and will be such a state whenev the muse of philosophi rule will you sai that the world is of anoth mind o my friend do not revil the world thei will soon chang their opinion if thei ar gentli entreat and ar taught the true natur of the philosoph who can hate a man who love him or be jealou of on who ha no jealousi consid again that the mani hate not the true but the fals philosophersth pretend who forc their wai in without invit and ar alwai speak of person and not of principl which is unlik the spirit of philosophi for the true philosoph despis earthli strife hi ey is fix on the etern order in accord with which he mould himself into the divin imag and not himself onli but other men and is the creator of the virtu privat as well as public when mankind see that the happi of state is onli to be found in that imag will thei be angri with us for attempt to delin it certainli not but what will be the process of delin the artist will do noth until he ha made a tabula rasa on thi he will inscrib the constitut of a state glanc often at the divin truth of natur and from that deriv the godlik among men mingl the two element rub out and paint in until there is a perfect harmoni or fusion of the divin and human but perhap the world will doubt the exist of such an artist what will thei doubt that the philosoph is a lover of truth have a natur akin to the bestand if thei admit thi will thei still quarrel with us for make philosoph our king thei will be less dispos to quarrel let us assum then that thei ar pacifi still a person mai hesit about the probabl of the son of a king be a philosoph and we do not deni that thei ar veri liabl to be corrupt but yet sure in the cours of ag there might be on exceptionand on is enough if on son of a king were a philosoph and had obedi citizen he might bring the ideal politi into be henc we conclud that our law ar not onli the best but that thei ar also possibl though not free from difficulti i gain noth by evad the troublesom question which aros concern women and children i will be wiser now and acknowledg that we must go to the bottom of anoth question what is to be the educ of our guardian it wa agre that thei were to be lover of their countri and were to be test in the refin fire of pleasur and pain and those who came forth pure and remain fix in their principl were to have honour and reward in life and after death but at thi point the argument put on her veil and turn into anoth path i hesit to make the assert which i now hazardthat our guardian must be philosoph you rememb all the contradictori element which met in the philosopherhow difficult to find them all in a singl person intellig and spirit ar not often combin with steadi the stolid fearless natur is avers to intellectu toil and yet these opposit element ar all necessari and therefor as we were sai befor the aspir must be test in pleasur and danger and also as we must now further add in the highest branch of knowledg you will rememb that when we spoke of the virtu mention wa made of a longer road which you were satisfi to leav unexplor enough seem to have been said enough my friend but what is enough while anyth remain want of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth he must be prepar to take the longer road or he will never reach that higher region which is abov the four virtu and of the virtu too he must not onli get an outlin but a clear and distinct vision strang that we should be so precis about trifl so careless about the highest truth and what ar the highest you to pretend unconsci when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good about which we know so littl and without which though a man gain the world he ha no profit of it some peopl imagin that the good is wisdom but thi involv a circleth good thei sai is wisdom wisdom ha to do with the good accord to other the good is pleasur but then come the absurd that good is bad for there ar bad pleasur as well as good again the good must have realiti a man mai desir the appear of virtu but he will not desir the appear of good ought our guardian then to be ignor of thi suprem principl of which everi man ha a presenti and without which no man ha ani real knowledg of anyth but socrat what is thi suprem principl knowledg or pleasur or what you mai think me troublesom but i sai that you have no busi to be alwai repeat the doctrin of other instead of give us your own can i sai what i do not know you mai offer an opinion and will the blind and crooked of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainti of scienc i will onli ask you to give such an explan of the good as you have given alreadi of temper and justic i wish that i could but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height of the knowledg of the good to the parent or princip i cannot introduc you but to the child begotten in hi imag which i mai compar with the interest on the princip i will audit the account and do not let me give you a fals statement of the debt you rememb our old distinct of the mani beauti and the on beauti the particular and the univers the object of sight and the object of thought did you ever consid that the object of sight impli a faculti of sight which is the most complex and costli of our sens requir not onli object of sens but also a medium which is light without which the sight will not distinguish between colour and all will be a blank for light is the nobl bond between the perceiv faculti and the thing perceiv and the god who give us light is the sun who is the ey of the dai but is not to be confound with the ey of man thi ey of the dai or sun is what i call the child of the good stand in the same relat to the visibl world as the good to the intellectu when the sun shine the ey see and in the intellectu world where truth is there is sight and light now that which is the sun of intellig natur is the idea of good the caus of knowledg and truth yet other and fairer than thei ar and stand in the same relat to them in which the sun stand to light o inconceiv height of beauti which is abov knowledg and abov truth you cannot sure mean pleasur he said peac i repli and thi idea of good like the sun is also the caus of growth and the author not of knowledg onli but of be yet greater far than either in digniti and power that is a reach of thought more than human but prai go on with the imag for i suspect that there is more behind there is i said and bear in mind our two sun or principl imagin further their correspond worldson of the visibl the other of the intellig you mai assist your fanci by figur the distinct under the imag of a line divid into two unequ part and mai again subdivid each part into two lesser segment repres of the stage of knowledg in either sphere the lower portion of the lower or visibl sphere will consist of shadow and reflect and it upper and smaller portion will contain real object in the world of natur or of art the sphere of the intellig will also have two divisionson of mathemat in which there is no ascent but all is descent no inquir into premis but onli draw of infer in thi divis the mind work with figur and number the imag of which ar taken not from the shadow but from the object although the truth of them is seen onli with the mind ey and thei ar us as hypothes without be analys wherea in the other divis reason us the hypothes as stage or step in the ascent to the idea of good to which she fasten them and then again descend walk firmli in the region of idea and of idea onli in her ascent as well as descent and final rest in them i partli understand he repli you mean that the idea of scienc ar superior to the hypothet metaphor concept of geometri and the other art or scienc whichev is to be the name of them and the latter concept you refus to make subject of pure intellect becaus thei have no first principl although when rest on a first principl thei pass into the higher sphere you understand me veri well i said and now to those four divis of knowledg you mai assign four correspond facultiespur intellig to the highest sphere activ intellig to the second to the third faith to the fourth the percept of shadowsand the clear of the sever faculti will be in the same ratio as the truth of the object to which thei ar relat like socrat we mai recapitul the virtu of the philosoph in languag which seem to reach beyond the horizon of that ag and countri he is describ as the spectat of all time and all exist he ha the noblest gift of natur and make the highest us of them all hi desir ar absorb in the love of wisdom which is the love of truth none of the grace of a beauti soul ar want in him neither can he fear death or think much of human life the ideal of modern time hardli retain the simplic of the antiqu there is not the same origin either in truth or error which character the greek the philosoph is no longer live in the unseen nor is he sent by an oracl to convinc mankind of ignor nor doe he regard knowledg as a system of idea lead upward by regular stage to the idea of good the eager of the pursuit ha abat there is more divis of labour and less of comprehens reflect upon natur and human life as a whole more of exact observ and less of anticip and inspir still in the alter condit of knowledg the parallel is not wholli lost and there mai be a us in translat the concept of plato into the languag of our own ag the philosoph in modern time is on who fix hi mind on the law of natur in their sequenc and connexion not on fragment or pictur of natur on histori not on controversi on the truth which ar acknowledg by the few not on the opinion of the mani he is awar of the import of classifi accord to natur and will try to separ the limb of scienc without break them phaedr there is no part of truth whether great or small which he will dishonour and in the least thing he will discern the greatest parmen like the ancient philosoph he see the world pervad by analog but he can also tell why in some case a singl instanc is suffici for an induct mill logic while in other case a thousand exampl would prove noth he inquir into a portion of knowledg onli becaus the whole ha grown too vast to be embrac by a singl mind or life he ha a clearer concept of the divis of scienc and of their relat to the mind of man than wa possibl to the ancient like plato he ha a vision of the uniti of knowledg not as the begin of philosophi to be attain by a studi of elementari mathemat but as the faroff result of the work of mani mind in mani ag he is awar that mathemat studi ar preliminari to almost everi other at the same time he will not reduc all varieti of knowledg to the type of mathemat he too must have a nobil of charact without which geniu lose the better half of great regard the world as a point in immens and each individu as a link in a neverend chain of exist he will not think much of hi own life or be greatli afraid of death adeimantu object first of all to the form of the socrat reason thu show that plato is awar of the imperfect of hi own method he bring the accus against himself which might be brought against him by a modern logicianthat he extract the answer becaus he know how to put the question in a long argument word ar apt to chang their mean slightli or premis mai be assum or conclus infer with rather too much certainti or univers the variat at each step mai be unobserv and yet at last the diverg becom consider henc the failur of attempt to appli arithmet or algebra formula to logic the imperfect or rather the higher and more elast natur of languag doe not allow word to have the precis of number or of symbol and thi qualiti in languag impair the forc of an argument which ha mani step the object though fairli met by socrat in thi particular instanc mai be regard as impli a reflect upon the socrat mode of reason and here as elsewher plato seem to intim that the time had come when the neg and interrog method of socrat must be supersed by a posit and construct on of which exampl ar given in some of the later dialogu adeimantu further argu that the ideal is wholli at varianc with fact for experi prove philosoph to be either useless or rogu contrari to all expect socrat ha no hesit in admit the truth of thi and explain the anomali in an allegori first characterist depreci hi own invent power in thi allegori the peopl ar distinguish from the profession politician and as elsewher ar spoken of in a tone of piti rather than of censur under the imag of the nobl captain who is not veri quick in hi percept the useless of philosoph is explain by the circumst that mankind will not us them the world in all ag ha been divid between contempt and fear of those who emploi the power of idea and know no other weapon concern the fals philosoph socrat argu that the best is most liabl to corrupt and that the finer natur is more like to suffer from alien condit we too observ that there ar some kind of excel which spring from a peculiar delicaci of constitut as is evid true of the poetic and imagin tempera which often seem to depend on impress and henc can onli breath or live in a certain atmospher the man of geniu ha greater pain and greater pleasur greater power and greater weak and often a greater plai of charact than is to be found in ordinari men he can assum the disguis of virtu or disinterested without have them or veil person enmiti in the languag of patriot and philosophyh can sai the word which all men ar think he ha an insight which is terribl into the folli and weak of hi fellowmen an alcibiad a mirabeau or a napoleon the first ar born either to be the author of great evil in state or of great good when thei ar drawn in that direct yet the thesi corruptio optimi pessima cannot be maintain gener or without regard to the kind of excel which is corrupt the alien condit which ar corrupt to on natur mai be the element of cultur to anoth in gener a man can onli receiv hi highest develop in a congeni state or famili among friend or fellowwork but also he mai sometim be stir by advers circumst to such a degre that he rise up against them and reform them and while weaker or coarser charact will extract good out of evil sai in a corrupt state of the church or of societi and live on happili allow the evil to remain the finer or stronger natur mai be crush or spoil by surround influencesmai becom misanthrop and philanthrop by turn or in a few instanc like the founder of the monast order or the reform ow to some peculiar in themselv or in their ag mai break awai entir from the world and from the church sometim into great good sometim into great evil sometim into both and the same hold in the lesser sphere of a convent a school a famili plato would have us consid how easili the best natur ar overpow by public opinion and what effort the rest of mankind will make to get possess of them the world the church their own profess ani polit or parti organ ar alwai carri them off their leg and teach them to appli high and holi name to their own prejudic and interest the monster corpor to which thei belong judg right and truth to be the pleasur of the commun the individu becom on with hi order or if he resist the world is too much for him and will sooner or later be reveng on him thi is perhap a onesid but not wholli untru pictur of the maxim and practic of mankind when thei sit down togeth at an assembl either in ancient or modern time when the higher natur ar corrupt by polit the lower take possess of the vacant place of philosophi thi is describ in on of those continu imag in which the argument to us a platon express veil herself and which is drop and reappear at interv the question is askedwhi ar the citizen of state so hostil to philosophi the answer is that thei do not know her and yet there is also a better mind of the mani thei would believ if thei were taught but hitherto thei have onli known a convent imit of philosophi word without thought system which have no life in them a divin person utter the word of beauti and freedom the friend of man hold communion with the etern and seek to frame the state in that imag thei have never known the same doubl feel respect the mass of mankind ha alwai exist among men the first thought is that the peopl ar the enemi of truth and right the second that thi onli aris out of an accident error and confus and that thei do not realli hate those who love them if thei could be educ to know them in the latter part of the sixth book three question have to be consid st the natur of the longer and more circuit wai which is contrast with the shorter and more imperfect method of book iv nd the heavenli pattern or idea of the state rd the relat of the divis of knowledg to on anoth and to the correspond faculti of the soul of the higher method of knowledg in plato we have onli a glimps neither here nor in the phaedru or symposium nor yet in the philebu or sophist doe he give ani clear explan of hi mean he would probabl have describ hi method as proceed by regular step to a system of univers knowledg which infer the part from the whole rather than the whole from the part thi ideal logic is not practis by him in the search after justic or in the analysi of the part of the soul there like aristotl in the nicomachean ethic he argu from experi and the common us of languag but at the end of the sixth book he conceiv anoth and more perfect method in which all idea ar onli step or grade or moment of thought form a connect whole which is selfsupport and in which consist is the test of truth he doe not explain to us in detail the natur of the process like mani other thinker both in ancient and modern time hi mind seem to be fill with a vacant form which he is unabl to realiz he suppos the scienc to have a natur order and connexion in an ag when thei can hardli be said to exist he is hasten on to the end of the intellectu world without even make a begin of them in modern time we hardli need to be remind that the process of acquir knowledg is here confus with the contempl of absolut knowledg in all scienc a priori and a posteriori truth mingl in variou proport the a priori part is that which is deriv from the most univers experi of men or is univers accept by them the a posteriori is that which grow up around the more gener principl and becom impercept on with them but plato erron imagin that the synthesi is separ from the analysi and that the method of scienc can anticip scienc in entertain such a vision of a priori knowledg he is suffici justifi or at least hi mean mai be suffici explain by the similar attempt of descart kant hegel and even of bacon himself in modern philosophi anticip or divin or prophet glimps of truth whether concern man or natur seem to stand in the same relat to ancient philosophi which hypothes bear to modern induct scienc these guess at truth were not made at random thei aros from a superfici impress of uniform and first principl in natur which the geniu of the greek contempl the expans of heaven and earth seem to recogn in the distanc nor can we deni that in ancient time knowledg must have stood still and the human mind been depriv of the veri instrument of thought if philosophi had been strictli confin to the result of experi plato suppos that when the tablet ha been made blank the artist will fill in the lineament of the ideal state is thi a pattern laid up in heaven or mere vacanc on which he is suppos to gaze with wonder ey the answer is that such ideal ar frame partli by the omiss of particular partli by imagin perfect the form which experi suppli phaedo plato repres these ideal in a figur as belong to anoth world and in modern time the idea will sometim seem to preced at other time to cooper with the hand of the artist as in scienc so also in creativ art there is a synthet as well as an analyt method on man will have the whole in hi mind befor he begin to anoth the process of mind and hand will be simultan there is no difficulti in see that plato divis of knowledg ar base first on the fundament antithesi of sensibl and intellectu which pervad the whole presocrat philosophi in which is impli also the opposit of the perman and transient of the univers and particular but the ag of philosophi in which he live seem to requir a further distinctionnumb and figur were begin to separ from idea the world could no longer regard justic as a cube and wa learn to see though imperfectli that the abstract of sens were distinct from the abstract of mind between the eleat be or essenc and the shadow of phenomena the pythagorean principl of number found a place and wa as aristotl remark a conduct medium from on to the other henc plato is led to introduc a third term which had not hitherto enter into the scheme of hi philosophi he had observ the us of mathemat in educ thei were the best prepar for higher studi the subject relat between them further suggest an object on although the passag from on to the other is realli imaginari metaph for metaphys and moral philosophi ha no connexion with mathemat number and figur ar the abstract of time and space not the express of pure intellectu concept when divest of metaphor a straight line or a squar ha no more to do with right and justic than a crook line with vice the figur associ wa mistaken for a real on and thu the three latter divis of the platon proport were construct there is more difficulti in comprehend how he arriv at the first term of the seri which is nowher els mention and ha no refer to ani other part of hi system nor inde doe the relat of shadow to object correspond to the relat of number to idea probabl plato ha been led by the love of analog timaeu to make four term instead of three although the object perceiv in both divis of the lower sphere ar equal object of sens he is also prepar the wai as hi manner is for the shadow of imag at the begin of the seventh book and the imit of an imit in the tenth the line mai be regard as reach from uniti to infin and is divid into two unequ part and subdivid into two more each lower sphere is the multipl of the preced of the four faculti faith in the lower divis ha an intermedi posit cp for the us of the word faith or belief greek timaeu contrast equal with the vagu of the percept of shadow greek and the higher certainti of understand greek and reason greek the differ between understand and mind or reason greek is analog to the differ between acquir knowledg in the part and the contempl of the whole true knowledg is a whole and is at rest consist and univers ar the test of truth to thi selfevidenc knowledg of the whole the faculti of mind is suppos to correspond but there is a knowledg of the understand which is incomplet and in motion alwai becaus unabl to rest in the subordin idea those idea ar call both imag and hypothesesimag becaus thei ar cloth in sens hypothes becaus thei ar assumpt onli until thei ar brought into connexion with the idea of good the gener mean of the passag nobl then is the bond which link togeth sightand of thi kind i spoke as the intellig so far as the thought contain in it admit of be translat into the term of modern philosophi mai be describ or explain as followsther is a truth on and selfexist to which by the help of a ladder let down from abov the human intellig mai ascend thi uniti is like the sun in the heaven the light by which all thing ar seen the be by which thei ar creat and sustain it is the idea of good and the step of the ladder lead up to thi highest or univers exist ar the mathemat scienc which also contain in themselv an element of the univers these too we see in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good thei then ceas to be hypothes or pictur and becom essenti part of a higher truth which is at onc their first principl and their final caus we cannot give ani more precis mean to thi remark passag but we mai trace in it sever rudiment or vestig of thought which ar common to us and to plato such as the uniti and correl of the scienc or rather of scienc for in plato time thei were not yet part off or distinguish the exist of a divin power or life or idea or caus or reason not yet conceiv or no longer conceiv as in the timaeu and elsewher under the form of a person the recognit of the hypothet and condit charact of the mathemat scienc and in a measur of everi scienc when isol from the rest the convict of a truth which is invis and of a law though hardli a law of natur which permeat the intellectu rather than the visibl world the method of socrat is hesit and tent await the fuller explan of the idea of good and of the natur of dialect in the seventh book the imperfect intellig of glaucon and the reluct of socrat to make a begin mark the difficulti of the subject the allus to theag bridl and to the intern oracl or demon sign of socrat which here as alwai in plato is onli prohibitori the remark that the salvat of ani remnant of good in the present evil state of the world is due to god onli the refer to a futur state of exist which is unknown to glaucon in the tenth book and in which the discuss of socrat and hi discipl would be resum the surpris in the answer the fanci ironi of socrat where he pretend that he can onli describ the strang posit of the philosoph in a figur of speech the origin observ that the sophist after all ar onli the repres and not the leader of public opinion the pictur of the philosoph stand asid in the shower of sleet under a wall the figur of the great beast follow by the express of goodwil toward the common peopl who would not have reject the philosoph if thei had known him the right nobl thought that the highest truth demand the greatest exact the hesit of socrat in return onc more to hi wellworn theme of the idea of good the ludicr earnest of glaucon the comparison of philosophi to a desert maiden who marri beneath herar some of the most interest characterist of the sixth book yet a few more word mai be ad on the old theme which wa so oft discuss in the socrat circl of which we like glaucon and adeimantu would fain if possibl have a clearer notion like them we ar dissatisfi when we ar told that the idea of good can onli be reveal to a student of the mathemat scienc and we ar inclin to think that neither we nor thei could have been led along that path to ani satisfactori goal for we have learn that differ of quantiti cannot pass into differ of qualiti and that the mathemat scienc can never rise abov themselv into the sphere of our higher thought although thei mai sometim furnish symbol and express of them and mai train the mind in habit of abstract and selfconcentr the illus which wa natur to an ancient philosoph ha ceas to be an illus to us but if the process by which we ar suppos to arriv at the idea of good be realli imaginari mai not the idea itself be also a mere abstract we remark first that in all ag and especi in primit philosophi word such as be essenc uniti good have exert an extraordinari influenc over the mind of men the meagr or neg of their content ha been in an invers ratio to their power thei have becom the form under which all thing were comprehend there wa a need or instinct in the human soul which thei satisfi thei were not idea but god and to thi new mytholog the men of a later gener began to attach the power and associ of the elder deiti the idea of good is on of those sacr word or form of thought which were begin to take the place of the old mytholog it meant uniti in which all time and all exist were gather up it wa the truth of all thing and also the light in which thei shone forth and becam evid to intellig human and divin it wa the caus of all thing the power by which thei were brought into be it wa the univers reason divest of a human person it wa the life as well as the light of the world all knowledg and all power were comprehend in it the wai to it wa through the mathemat scienc and these too were depend on it to ask whether god wa the maker of it or made by it would be like ask whether god could be conceiv apart from good or good apart from god the god of the timaeu is not realli at varianc with the idea of good thei ar aspect of the same differ onli as the person from the imperson or the masculin from the neuter the on be the express or languag of mytholog the other of philosophi thi or someth like thi is the mean of the idea of good as conceiv by plato idea of number order harmoni develop mai also be said to enter into it the paraphras which ha just been given of it goe beyond the actual word of plato we have perhap arriv at the stage of philosophi which enabl us to understand what he is aim at better than he did himself we ar begin to realiz what he saw darkli and at a distanc but if he could have been told that thi or some concept of the same kind but higher than thi wa the truth at which he wa aim and the need which he sought to suppli he would gladli have recogn that more wa contain in hi own thought than he himself knew as hi word ar few and hi manner retic and tent so must the style of hi interpret be we should not approach hi mean more nearli by attempt to defin it further in translat him into the languag of modern thought we might insens lose the spirit of ancient philosophi it is remark that although plato speak of the idea of good as the first principl of truth and be it is nowher mention in hi write except in thi passag nor did it retain ani hold upon the mind of hi discipl in a later gener it wa probabl unintellig to them nor doe the mention of it in aristotl appear to have ani refer to thi or ani other passag in hi extant write book vii and now i will describ in a figur the enlighten or unenlighten of our natureimagin human be live in an underground den which is open toward the light thei have been there from childhood have their neck and leg chain and can onli see into the den at a distanc there is a fire and between the fire and the prison a rais wai and a low wall is built along the wai like the screen over which marionett player show their puppet behind the wall appear move figur who hold in their hand variou work of art and among them imag of men and anim wood and stone and some of the passersbi ar talk and other silent a strang parabl he said and strang captiv thei ar ourselv i repli and thei see onli the shadow of the imag which the fire throw on the wall of the den to these thei give name and if we add an echo which return from the wall the voic of the passeng will seem to proce from the shadow suppos now that you suddenli turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselv at the real imag will thei believ them to be real will not their ey be dazzl and will thei not try to get awai from the light to someth which thei ar abl to behold without blink and suppos further that thei ar drag up a steep and rug ascent into the presenc of the sun himself will not their sight be darken with the excess of light some time will pass befor thei get the habit of perceiv at all and at first thei will be abl to perceiv onli shadow and reflect in the water then thei will recogn the moon and the star and will at length behold the sun in hi own proper place as he is last of all thei will concludethi is he who give us the year and the season and is the author of all that we see how will thei rejoic in pass from dark to light how worthless to them will seem the honour and glori of the den but now imagin further that thei descend into their old habitationsin that underground dwell thei will not see as well as their fellow and will not be abl to compet with them in the measur of the shadow on the wall there will be mani joke about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost hi ey and if thei find anybodi try to set free and enlighten on of their number thei will put him to death if thei can catch him now the cave or den is the world of sight the fire is the sun the wai upward is the wai to knowledg and in the world of knowledg the idea of good is last seen and with difficulti but when seen is infer to be the author of good and rightpar of the lord of light in thi world and of truth and understand in the other he who attain to the beatif vision is alwai go upward he is unwil to descend into polit assembl and court of law for hi ey ar apt to blink at the imag or shadow of imag which thei behold in themh cannot enter into the idea of those who have never in their live understood the relat of the shadow to the substanc but blind is of two kind and mai be caus either by pass out of dark into light or out of light into dark and a man of sens will distinguish between them and will not laugh equal at both of them but the blind which aris from ful of light he will deem bless and piti the other or if he laugh at the puzzl soul look at the sun he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabit of the den at those who descend from abov there is a further lesson taught by thi parabl of our some person fanci that instruct is like give ey to the blind but we sai that the faculti of sight wa alwai there and that the soul onli requir to be turn round toward the light and thi is convers other virtu ar almost like bodili habit and mai be acquir in the same manner but intellig ha a divin life and is indestruct turn either to good or evil accord to the direct given did you never observ how the mind of a clever rogu peer out of hi ey and the more clearli he see the more evil he doe now if you take such an on and cut awai from him those leaden weight of pleasur and desir which bind hi soul to earth hi intellig will be turn round and he will behold the truth as clearli as he now discern hi meaner end and have we not decid that our ruler must neither be so uneduc as to have no fix rule of life nor so overeduc as to be unwil to leav their paradis for the busi of the world we must choos out therefor the natur who ar most like to ascend to the light and knowledg of the good but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light thei must be forc down again among the captiv in the den to partak of their labour and honour will thei not think thi a hardship you should rememb that our purpos in frame the state wa not that our citizen should do what thei like but that thei should serv the state for the common good of all mai we not fairli sai to our philosopherfriend we do you no wrong for in other state philosophi grow wild and a wild plant ow noth to the garden but you have been train by us to be the ruler and king of our hive and therefor we must insist on your descend into the den you must each of you take your turn and becom abl to us your ey in the dark and with a littl practic you will see far better than those who quarrel about the shadow whose knowledg is a dream onli whilst your is a wake realiti it mai be that the saint or philosoph who is best fit mai also be the least inclin to rule but necess is laid upon him and he must no longer live in the heaven of idea and thi will be the salvat of the state for those who rule must not be those who ar desir to rule and if you can offer to our citizen a better life than that of ruler gener is there will be a chanc that the rich not onli in thi world good but in virtu and wisdom mai bear rule and the onli life which is better than the life of polit ambit is that of philosophi which is also the best prepar for the govern of a state then now come the questionhow shall we creat our ruler what wai is there from dark to light the chang is effect by philosophi it is not the turn over of an oystershel but the convers of a soul from night to dai from becom to be and what train will draw the soul upward our former educ had two branch gymnast which wa occupi with the bodi and music the sister art which infus a natur harmoni into mind and literatur but neither of these scienc gave ani promis of do what we want noth remain to us but that univers or primari scienc of which all the art and scienc ar partak i mean number or calcul veri true includ the art of war ye certainli then there is someth ludicr about palamed in the tragedi come in and sai that he had invent number and had count the rank and set them in order for if agamemnon could not count hi feet and without number how could he he must have been a pretti sort of gener inde no man should be a soldier who cannot count and inde he is hardli to be call a man but i am not speak of these practic applic of arithmet for number in my view is rather to be regard as a conductor to thought and be i will explain what i mean by the last expressionth sensibl ar of two kind the on class invit or stimul the mind while in the other the mind acquiesc now the stimul class ar the thing which suggest contrast and relat for exampl suppos that i hold up to the ey three fingersa fore finger a middl finger a littl fingerth sight equal recogn all three finger but without number cannot further distinguish them or again suppos two object to be rel great and small these idea of great and small ar suppli not by the sens but by the mind and the percept of their contrast or relat quicken and set in motion the mind which is puzzl by the confus intim of sens and ha recours to number in order to find out whether the thing indic ar on or more than on number repli that thei ar two and not on and ar to be distinguish from on anoth again the sight behold great and small but onli in a confus chao and not until thei ar distinguish doe the question aris of their respect natur we ar thu led on to the distinct between the visibl and intellig that wa what i meant when i spoke of stimul to the intellect i wa think of the contradict which aris in percept the idea of uniti for exampl like that of a finger doe not arous thought unless involv some concept of plural but when the on is also the opposit of on the contradict give rise to reflect an exampl of thi is afford by ani object of sight all number ha also an elev effect it rais the mind out of the foam and flux of gener to the contempl of be have lesser militari and retail us also the retail us is not requir by us but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosoph the militari on mai be retain and to our higher purpos no scienc can be better adapt but it must be pursu in the spirit of a philosoph not of a shopkeep it is concern not with visibl object but with abstract truth for number ar pure abstractionsth true arithmetician indignantli deni that hi unit is capabl of divis when you divid he insist that you ar onli multipli hi on is not materi or resolv into fraction but an unvari and absolut equal and thi prove the pure intellectu charact of hi studi note also the great power which arithmet ha of sharpen the wit no other disciplin is equal sever or an equal test of gener abil or equal improv to a stupid person let our second branch of educ be geometri i can easili see repli glaucon that the skill of the gener will be doubl by hi knowledg of geometri that is a small matter the us of geometri to which i refer is the assist given by it in the contempl of the idea of good and the compel the mind to look at true be and not at gener onli yet the present mode of pursu these studi as ani on who is the least of a mathematician is awar is mean and ridicul thei ar made to look downward to the art and not upward to etern exist the geomet is alwai talk of squar subtend appos as if he had in view action wherea knowledg is the real object of the studi it should elev the soul and creat the mind of philosophi it should rais up what ha fallen down not to speak of lesser us in war and militari tactic and in the improv of the faculti shall we propos as a third branch of our educ astronomi veri good repli glaucon the knowledg of the heaven is necessari at onc for husbandri navig militari tactic i like your wai of give us reason for everyth in order to make friend of the world and there is a difficulti in prove to mankind that educ is not onli us inform but a purif of the ey of the soul which is better than the bodili ey for by thi alon is truth seen now will you appeal to mankind in gener or to the philosoph or would you prefer to look to yourself onli everi man is hi own best friend then take a step backward for we ar out of order and insert the third dimens which is of solid after the second which is of plane and then you mai proce to solid in motion but solid geometri is not popular and ha not the patronag of the state nor is the us of it fulli recogn the difficulti is great and the votari of the studi ar conceit and impati still the charm of the pursuit win upon men and if govern would lend a littl assist there might be great progress made veri true repli glaucon but do i understand you now to begin with plane geometri and to place next geometri of solid and thirdli astronomi or the motion of solid ye i said my hasti ha onli hinder us veri good and now let us proce to astronomi about which i am will to speak in your lofti strain no on can fail to see that the contempl of the heaven draw the soul upward i am an except then astronomi as studi at present appear to me to draw the soul not upward but downward stargaz is just look up at the ceilingno better a man mai lie on hi back on land or on waterh mai look up or look down but there is no scienc in that the vision of knowledg of which i speak is seen not with the ey but with the mind all the magnific of the heaven is but the embroideri of a copi which fall far short of the divin origin and teach noth about the absolut harmoni or motion of thing their beauti is like the beauti of figur drawn by the hand of daedalu or ani other great artist which mai be us for illustr but no mathematician would seek to obtain from them true concept of equal or numer relat how ridicul then to look for these in the map of the heaven in which the imperfect of matter come in everywher as a disturb element mar the symmetri of dai and night of month and year of the sun and star in their cours onli by problem can we place astronomi on a truli scientif basi let the heaven alon and exert the intellect still mathemat admit of other applic as the pythagorean sai and we agre there is a sister scienc of harmon motion adapt to the ear as astronomi is to the ey and there mai be other applic also let us inquir of the pythagorean about them not forget that we have an aim higher than their which is the relat of these scienc to the idea of good the error which pervad astronomi also pervad harmon the musician put their ear in the place of their mind ye repli glaucon i like to see them lai their ear alongsid of their neighbour facessom sai that a new note other declar that the two note ar the same ye i said but you mean the empir who ar alwai twist and tortur the string of the lyre and quarrel about the temper of the string i am refer rather to the pythagorean harmonist who ar almost equal in error for thei investig onli the number of the conson which ar heard and ascend no higherof the true numer harmoni which is unheard and is onli to be found in problem thei have not even a concept that last he said must be a marvel thing a thing i repli which is onli us if pursu with a view to the good all these scienc ar the prelud of the strain and ar profit if thei ar regard in their natur relat to on anoth i dare sai socrat said glaucon but such a studi will be an endless busi what studi do you meanof the prelud or what for all these thing ar onli the prelud and you sure do not suppos that a mere mathematician is also a dialectician certainli not i have hardli ever known a mathematician who could reason and yet glaucon is not true reason that hymn of dialect which is the music of the intellectu world and which wa by us compar to the effort of sight when from behold the shadow on the wall we arriv at last at the imag which gave the shadow even so the dialect faculti withdraw from sens arriv by the pure intellect at the contempl of the idea of good and never rest but at the veri end of the intellectu world and the royal road out of the cave into the light and the blink of the ey at the sun and turn to contempl the shadow of realiti not the shadow of an imag onlythi progress and gradual acquisit of a new faculti of sight by the help of the mathemat scienc is the elev of the soul to the contempl of the highest ideal of be so far i agre with you but now leav the prelud let us proce to the hymn what then is the natur of dialect and what ar the path which lead thither dear glaucon you cannot follow me here there can be no revel of the absolut truth to on who ha not been disciplin in the previou scienc but that there is a scienc of absolut truth which is attain in some wai veri differ from those now practis i am confid for all other art or scienc ar rel to human need and opinion and the mathemat scienc ar but a dream or hypothesi of true be and never analys their own principl dialect alon rise to the principl which is abov hypothes convert and gentli lead the ey of the soul out of the barbar slough of ignor into the light of the upper world with the help of the scienc which we have been describingsci as thei ar often term although thei requir some other name impli greater clear than opinion and less clear than scienc and thi in our previou sketch wa understand and so we get four namestwo for intellect and two for opinionreason or mind understand faith percept of shadowswhich make a proport beingbecomingintellectopinionand sciencebeliefunderstand percept of shadow dialect mai be further describ as that scienc which defin and explain the essenc or be of each natur which distinguish and abstract the good and is readi to do battl against all oppon in the caus of good to him who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepi dream and mani a man is in hi grave befor hi is well wake up and would you have the futur ruler of your ideal state intellig be or stupid as post certainli not the latter then you must train them in dialect which will teach them to ask and answer question and is the copingston of the scienc i dare sai that you have not forgotten how our ruler were chosen and the process of select mai be carri a step furthera befor thei must be constant and valiant goodlook and of nobl manner but now thei must also have natur abil which educ will improv that is to sai thei must be quick at learn capabl of mental toil retent solid dilig natur who combin intellectu with moral virtu not lame and onesid dilig in bodili exercis and indol in mind or convers not a maim soul which hate falsehood and yet unintention is alwai wallow in the mire of ignor not a bastard or feebl person but sound in wind and limb and in perfect condit for the great gymnast trial of the mind justic herself can find no fault with natur such as these and thei will be the saviour of our state discipl of anoth sort would onli make philosophi more ridicul than she is at present forgiv my enthusiasm i am becom excit but when i see her trampl underfoot i am angri at the author of her disgrac i did not notic that you were more excit than you ought to have been but i felt that i wa now do not let us forget anoth point in the select of our disciplesthat thei must be young and not old for solon is mistaken in sai that an old man can be alwai learn youth is the time of studi and here we must rememb that the mind is free and dainti and unlik the bodi must not be made to work against the grain learn should be at first a sort of plai in which the natur bent is detect as in train them for war the young dog should at first onli tast blood but when the necessari gymnast ar over which dure two or three year divid life between sleep and bodili exercis then the educ of the soul will becom a more seriou matter at twenti year of ag a select must be made of the more promis discipl with whom a new epoch of educ will begin the scienc which thei have hitherto learn in fragment will now be brought into relat with each other and with true be for the power of combin them is the test of specul and dialect abil and afterward at thirti a further select shall be made of those who ar abl to withdraw from the world of sens into the abstract of idea but at thi point judg from present experi there is a danger that dialect mai be the sourc of mani evil the danger mai be illustr by a parallel caseimagin a person who ha been brought up in wealth and luxuri amid a crowd of flatter and who is suddenli inform that he is a supposititi son he ha hitherto honour hi reput parent and disregard the flatter and now he doe the revers thi is just what happen with a man principl there ar certain doctrin which he learnt at home and which exercis a parent author over him present he find that imput ar cast upon them a troublesom querist come and ask what is the just and good or prove that virtu is vice and vice virtu and hi mind becom unsettl and he ceas to love honour and obei them as he ha hitherto done he is seduc into the life of pleasur and becom a lawless person and a rogu the case of such specul is veri pitiabl and in order that our thirti year old pupil mai not requir thi piti let us take everi possibl care that young person do not studi philosophi too earli for a young man is a sort of puppi who onli plai with an argument and is reason into and out of hi opinion everi dai he soon begin to believ noth and bring himself and philosophi into discredit a man of thirti doe not run on in thi wai he will argu and not mere contradict and add new honour to philosophi by the sobrieti of hi conduct what time shall we allow for thi second gymnast train of the soulsai twice the time requir for the gymnast of the bodi six or perhap five year to commenc at thirti and then for fifteen year let the student go down into the den and command armi and gain experi of life at fifti let him return to the end of all thing and have hi ey uplift to the idea of good and order hi life after that pattern if necessari take hi turn at the helm of state and train up other to be hi successor when hi time come he shall depart in peac to the island of the blest he shall be honour with sacrific and receiv such worship as the pythian oracl approv you ar a statuari socrat and have made a perfect imag of our governor ye and of our gover for the women will share in all thing with the men and you will admit that our state is not a mere aspir but mai realli come into be when there shall aris philosopherk on or more who will despis earthli vaniti and will be the servant of justic onli and how will thei begin their work their first act will be to send awai into the countri all those who ar more than ten year of ag and to proce with those who ar left at the commenc of the sixth book plato anticip hi explan of the relat of the philosoph to the world in an allegori in thi as in other passag follow the order which he prescrib in educ and proceed from the concret to the abstract at the commenc of book vii under the figur of a cave have an open toward a fire and a wai upward to the true light he return to view the divis of knowledg exhibit familiarli as in a pictur the result which had been hardli won by a great effort of thought in the previou discuss at the same time cast a glanc onward at the dialect process which is repres by the wai lead from dark to light the shadow the imag the reflect of the sun and star in the water the star and sun themselv sever correspondth first to the realm of fanci and poetryth second to the world of senseth third to the abstract or univers of sens of which the mathemat scienc furnish the typeth fourth and last to the same abstract when seen in the uniti of the idea from which thei deriv a new mean and power the true dialect process begin with the contempl of the real star and not mere reflect of them and end with the recognit of the sun or idea of good as the parent not onli of light but of warmth and growth to the divis of knowledg the stage of educ partli answerfirst there is the earli educ of childhood and youth in the fanci of the poet and in the law and custom of the statethen there is the train of the bodi to be a warrior athlet and a good servant of the mindand thirdli after an interv follow the educ of later life which begin with mathemat and proce to philosophi in gener there seem to be two great aim in the philosophi of platofirst to realiz abstract secondli to connect them accord to him the true educ is that which draw men from becom to be and to a comprehens survei of all be he desir to develop in the human mind the faculti of see the univers in all thing until at last the particular of sens drop awai and the univers alon remain he then seek to combin the univers which he ha disengag from sens not perceiv that the correl of them ha no other basi but the common us of languag he never understand that abstract as hegel sai ar mere abstractionsof us when emploi in the arrang of fact but ad noth to the sum of knowledg when pursu apart from them or with refer to an imaginari idea of good still the exercis of the faculti of abstract apart from fact ha enlarg the mind and plai a great part in the educ of the human race plato appreci the valu of thi faculti and saw that it might be quicken by the studi of number and relat all thing in which there is opposit or proport ar suggest of reflect the mere impress of sens evok no power of thought or of mind but when sensibl object ask to be compar and distinguish then philosophi begin the scienc of arithmet first suggest such distinct the follow in order the other scienc of plain and solid geometri and of solid in motion on branch of which is astronomi or the harmoni of the spheresto thi is append the sister scienc of the harmoni of sound plato seem also to hint at the possibl of other applic of arithmet or mathemat proport such as we emploi in chemistri and natur philosophi such as the pythagorean and even aristotl make us of in ethic and polit eg hi distinct between arithmet and geometr proport in the ethic book v or between numer and proport equal in the polit the modern mathematician will readili sympathis with plato delight in the properti of pure mathemat he will not be disinclin to sai with himlet alon the heaven and studi the beauti of number and figur in themselv he too will be apt to depreci their applic to the art he will observ that plato ha a concept of geometri in which figur ar to be dispens with thu in a distant and shadowi wai seem to anticip the possibl of work geometr problem by a more gener mode of analysi he will remark with interest on the backward state of solid geometri which ala wa not encourag by the aid of the state in the ag of plato and he will recogn the grasp of plato mind in hi abil to conceiv of on scienc of solid in motion includ the earth as well as the heavensnot forget to notic the intim to which allus ha been alreadi made that besid astronomi and harmon the scienc of solid in motion mai have other applic still more will he be struck with the comprehens of view which led plato at a time when these scienc hardli exist to sai that thei must be studi in relat to on anoth and to the idea of good or common principl of truth and be but he will also see and perhap without surpris that in that stage of physic and mathemat knowledg plato ha fallen into the error of suppos that he can construct the heaven a priori by mathemat problem and determin the principl of harmoni irrespect of the adapt of sound to the human ear the illus wa a natur on in that ag and countri the simplic and certainti of astronomi and harmon seem to contrast with the variat and complex of the world of sens henc the circumst that there wa some elementari basi of fact some measur of distanc or time or vibrat on which thei must ultim rest wa overlook by him the modern predecessor of newton fell into error equal great and plato can hardli be said to have been veri far wrong or mai even claim a sort of prophet insight into the subject when we consid that the greater part of astronomi at the present dai consist of abstract dynam by the help of which most astronom discoveri have been made the metaphys philosoph from hi point of view recogn mathemat as an instrument of educationwhich strengthen the power of attent develop the sens of order and the faculti of construct and enabl the mind to grasp under simpl formula the quantit differ of physic phenomena but while acknowledg their valu in educ he see also that thei have no connexion with our higher moral and intellectu idea in the attempt which plato make to connect them we easili trace the influenc of ancient pythagorean notion there is no reason to suppos that he is speak of the ideal number but he is describ number which ar pure abstract to which he assign a real and separ exist which as the teacher of the art mean probabl the pythagorean would have affirm repel all attempt at subdivis and in which uniti and everi other number ar conceiv of as absolut the truth and certainti of number when thu disengag from phenomena gave them a kind of sacred in the ey of an ancient philosoph nor is it easi to sai how far idea of order and fixed mai have had a moral and elev influenc on the mind of men who in the word of the timaeu might learn to regul their er live accord to them it is worthi of remark that the old pythagorean ethic symbol still exist as figur of speech among ourselv and those who in modern time see the world pervad by univers law mai also see an anticip of thi last word of modern philosophi in the platon idea of good which is the sourc and measur of all thing and yet onli an abstract philebu two passag seem to requir more particular explan first that which relat to the analysi of vision the difficulti in thi passag mai be explain like mani other from differ in the mode of concept prevail among ancient and modern thinker to us the percept of sens ar insepar from the act of the mind which accompani them the conscious of form colour distanc is indistinguish from the simpl sensat which is the medium of them wherea to plato sens is the heraclitean flux of sens not the vision of object in the order in which thei actual present themselv to the experienc sight but as thei mai be imagin to appear confus and blur to the halfawaken ey of the infant the first action of the mind is arous by the attempt to set in order thi chao and the reason is requir to frame distinct concept under which the confus impress of sens mai be arrang henc aris the question what is great what is small and thu begin the distinct of the visibl and the intellig the second difficulti relat to plato concept of harmon three class of harmonist ar distinguish by himfirst the pythagorean whom he propos to consult as in the previou discuss on music he wa to consult damonthei ar acknowledg to be master in the art but ar altogeth defici in the knowledg of it higher import and relat to the good secondli the mere empir whom glaucon appear to confus with them and whom both he and socrat ludicr describ as experi by mere auscult on the interv of sound both of these fall short in differ degre of the platon idea of harmoni which must be studi in a pure abstract wai first by the method of problem and secondli as a part of univers knowledg in relat to the idea of good the allegori ha a polit as well as a philosoph mean the den or cave repres the narrow sphere of polit or law compar the descript of the philosoph and lawyer in the theaetetu and the light of the etern idea is suppos to exercis a disturb influenc on the mind of those who return to thi lower world in other word their principl ar too wide for practic applic thei ar look far awai into the past and futur when their busi is with the present the ideal is not easili reduc to the condit of actual life and mai often be at varianc with them and at first those who return ar unabl to compet with the inhabit of the den in the measur of the shadow and ar derid and persecut by them but after a while thei see the thing below in far truer proport than those who have never ascend into the upper world the differ between the politician turn into a philosoph and the philosoph turn into a politician is symbol by the two kind of disord eyesight the on which is experienc by the captiv who is transfer from dark to dai the other of the heavenli messeng who voluntarili for the good of hi fellowmen descend into the den in what wai the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabit of the lower world or how the idea of good is to becom the guid principl of polit is left unexplain by plato like the natur and divis of dialect of which glaucon impati demand to be inform perhap he would have said that the explan could not be given except to a discipl of the previou scienc symposium mani illustr of thi part of the republ mai be found in modern polit and in daili life for among ourselv too there have been two sort of politician or statesmen whose eyesight ha becom disord in two differ wai first there have been great men who in the languag of burk have been too much given to gener maxim who like js mill or burk himself have been theorist or philosoph befor thei were politician or who have been student of histori have allow some great histor parallel such as the english revolut of or possibl athenian democraci or roman imperi to be the medium through which thei view contemporari event or perhap the long project shadow of some exist institut mai have darken their vision the church of the futur the commonwealth of the futur the societi of the futur have so absorb their mind that thei ar unabl to see in their true proport the polit of todai thei have been intox with great idea such as liberti or equal or the greatest happi of the greatest number or the brotherhood of human and thei no longer care to consid how these idea must be limit in practic or harmon with the condit of human life thei ar full of light but the light to them ha becom onli a sort of lumin mist or blind almost everi on ha known some enthusiast halfeduc person who see everyth at fals distanc and in erron proport with thi disord of eyesight mai be contrast anotherof those who see not far into the distanc but what is near onli who have been engag all their live in a trade or a profess who ar limit to a set or sect of their own men of thi kind have no univers except their own interest or the interest of their class no principl but the opinion of person like themselv no knowledg of affair beyond what thei pick up in the street or at their club suppos them to be sent into a larger world to undertak some higher call from be tradesmen to turn gener or politician from be schoolmast to becom philosophersor imagin them on a sudden to receiv an inward light which reveal to them for the first time in their live a higher idea of god and the exist of a spiritu world by thi sudden convers or chang is not their daili life like to be upset and on the other hand will not mani of their old prejudic and narrow still adher to them long after thei have begun to take a more comprehens view of human thing from familiar exampl like these we mai learn what plato meant by the eyesight which is liabl to two kind of disord nor have we ani difficulti in draw a parallel between the young athenian in the fifth centuri befor christ who becam unsettl by new idea and the student of a modern univers who ha been the subject of a similar aufklarung we too observ that when young men begin to criticis customari belief or to analys the constitut of human natur thei ar apt to lose hold of solid principl greek thei ar like tree which have been frequent transplant the earth about them is loos and thei have no root reach far into the soil thei light upon everi flower follow their own wayward will or becaus the wind blow them thei catch opinion as diseas ar caughtwhen thei ar in the air born hither and thither thei speedili fall into belief the opposit of those in which thei were brought up thei hardli retain the distinct of right and wrong thei seem to think on thing as good as anoth thei suppos themselv to be search after truth when thei ar plai the game of follow my leader thei fall in love at first sight with paradox respect moral some fanci about art some novelti or eccentr in religion and like lover thei ar so absorb for a time in their new notion that thei can think of noth els the resolut of some philosoph or theolog question seem to them more interest and import than ani substanti knowledg of literatur or scienc or even than a good life like the youth in the philebu thei ar readi to discours to ani on about a new philosophi thei ar gener the discipl of some emin professor or sophist whom thei rather imit than understand thei mai be count happi if in later year thei retain some of the simpl truth which thei acquir in earli educ and which thei mai perhap find to be worth all the rest such is the pictur which plato draw and which we onli reproduc partli in hi own word of the danger which beset youth in time of transit when old opinion ar fade awai and the new ar not yet firmli establish their condit is ingeni compar by him to that of a supposititi son who ha made the discoveri that hi reput parent ar not hi real on and in consequ thei have lost their author over him the distinct between the mathematician and the dialectician is also notic plato is veri well awar that the faculti of the mathematician is quit distinct from the higher philosoph sens which recogn and combin first principl the contempt which he express for distinct of word the danger of involuntari falsehood the apolog which socrat make for hi earnest of speech ar highli characterist of the platon style and mode of thought the quaint notion that if palamed wa the inventor of number agamemnon could not have count hi feet the art by which we ar made to believ that thi state of our is not a dream onli the graviti with which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state name the send out of the citi all who had arriv at ten year of ag in order to expedit the busi of educ by a gener ar also truli platon for the last compar the passag at the end of the third book in which he expect the lie about the earthborn men to be believ in the second gener book viii and so we have arriv at the conclus that in the perfect state wive and children ar to be in common and the educ and pursuit of men and women both in war and peac ar to be common and king ar to be philosoph and warrior and the soldier of the state ar to live togeth have all thing in common and thei ar to be warrior athlet receiv no pai but onli their food from the other citizen now let us return to the point at which we digress that is easili done he repli you were speak of the state which you had construct and of the individu who answer to thi both of whom you affirm to be good and you said that of inferior state there were four form and four individu correspond to them which although defici in variou degre were all of them worth inspect with a view to determin the rel happi or miseri of the best or worst man then polemarchu and adeimantu interrupt you and thi led to anoth argumentand so here we ar suppos that we put ourselv again in the same posit and do you repeat your question i should like to know of what constitut you were speak besid the perfect state there ar onli four of ani note in hellasfirst the famou lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth secondli oligarchi a state full of evil thirdli democraci which follow next in order fourthli tyranni which is the diseas or death of all govern now state ar not made of oak and rock but of flesh and blood and therefor as there ar five state there must be five human natur in individu which correspond to them and first there is the ambiti natur which answer to the lacedaemonian state secondli the oligarch natur thirdli the democrat and fourthli the tyrann thi last will have to be compar with the perfectli just which is the fifth that we mai know which is the happier and then we shall be abl to determin whether the argument of thrasymachu or our own is the more convinc and as befor we began with the state and went on to the individu so now begin with timocraci let us go on to the timocrat man and then proce to the other form of govern and the individu who answer to them but how did timocraci aris out of the perfect state plainli like all chang of govern from divis in the ruler but whenc came divis sing heavenli muse as homer sayslet them condescend to answer us as if we were children to whom thei put on a solemn face in jest and what will thei sai thei will sai that human thing ar fate to decai and even the perfect state will not escap from thi law of destini when the wheel come full circl in a period short or long plant or anim have time of fertil and steril which the intellig of ruler becaus alloi by sens will not enabl them to ascertain and children will be born out of season for wherea divin creation ar in a perfect cycl or number the human creation is in a number which declin from perfect and ha four term and three interv of number increas wane assimil dissimil and yet perfectli commensur with each other the base of the number with a fourth ad or which is multipli by five and cube give two harmoniesth first a squar number which is a hundr time the base or a hundr time a hundr the second an oblong be a hundr squar of the ration diamet of a figur the side of which is five subtract on from each squar or two perfect squar from all and ad a hundr cube of three thi entir number is geometr and contain the rule or law of gener when thi law is neglect marriag will be unpropiti the inferior offspr who ar then born will in time becom the ruler the state will declin and educ fall into decai gymnast will be prefer to music and the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic massthu divis will aris such is the muse answer to our question and a true answer of coursebut what more have thei to sai thei sai that the two race the iron and brass and the silver and gold will draw the state differ waysth on will take to trade and moneymak and the other have the true rich and not care for monei will resist them the contest will end in a compromis thei will agre to have privat properti and will enslav their fellowcitizen who were onc their friend and nurtur but thei will retain their warlik charact and will be chiefli occupi in fight and exercis rule thu aris timocraci which is intermedi between aristocraci and oligarchi the new form of govern resembl the ideal in obedi to ruler and contempt for trade and have common meal and in devot to warlik and gymnast exercis but corrupt ha crept into philosophi and simplic of charact which wa onc her note is now look for onli in the militari class art of war begin to prevail over art of peac the ruler is no longer a philosoph as in oligarchi there spring up among them an extravag love of gainget anoth man and save your own is their principl and thei have dark place in which thei hoard their gold and silver for the us of their women and other thei take their pleasur by stealth like boi who ar run awai from their fatherth law and their educ is not inspir by the muse but impos by the strong arm of power the lead characterist of thi state is parti spirit and ambit and what manner of man answer to such a state in love of content repli adeimantu he will be like our friend glaucon in that respect perhap but not in other he is selfassert and illeduc yet fond of literatur although not himself a speakerfierc with slave but obedi to ruler a lover of power and honour which he hope to gain by deed of armsfond too of gymnast and of hunt as he advanc in year he grow avarici for he ha lost philosophi which is the onli saviour and guardian of men hi origin is as followshi father is a good man dwell in an illord state who ha retir from polit in order that he mai lead a quiet life hi mother is angri at her loss of preced among other women she is disgust at her husband selfish and she expati to her son on the unmanli and indol of hi father the old famili servant take up the tale and sai to the youthwhen you grow up you must be more of a man than your father all the world ar agre that he who mind hi own busi is an idiot while a busybodi is highli honour and esteem the young man compar thi spirit with hi father word and wai and as he is natur well dispos although he ha suffer from evil influenc he rest at a middl point and becom ambiti and a lover of honour and now let us set anoth citi over against anoth man the next form of govern is oligarchi in which the rule is of the rich onli nor is it difficult to see how such a state aris the declin begin with the possess of gold and silver illeg mode of expenditur ar invent on draw anoth on and the multitud ar infect rich outweigh virtu lover of monei take the place of lover of honour miser of politician and in time polit privileg ar confin by law to the rich who do not shrink from violenc in order to effect their purpos thu much of the originlet us next consid the evil of oligarchi would a man who want to be safe on a voyag take a bad pilot becaus he wa rich or refus a good on becaus he wa poor and doe not the analog appli still more to the state and there ar yet greater evil two nation ar struggl togeth in oneth rich and the poor and the rich dare not put arm into the hand of the poor and ar unwil to pai for defend out of their own monei and have we not alreadi condemn that state in which the same person ar warrior as well as shopkeep the greatest evil of all is that a man mai sell hi properti and have no place in the state while there is on class which ha enorm wealth the other is entir destitut but observ that these destitut had not realli ani more of the govern natur in them when thei were rich than now that thei ar poor thei were miser spendthrift alwai thei ar the drone of the hive onli wherea the actual drone is unprovid by natur with a sting the twoleg thing whom we call drone ar some of them without sting and some of them have dread sting in other word there ar pauper and there ar rogu these ar never far apart and in oligarch citi where nearli everybodi is a pauper who is not a ruler you will find abund of both and thi evil state of societi origin in bad educ and bad govern like state like manth chang in the latter begin with the repres of timocraci he walk at first in the wai of hi father who mai have been a statesman or gener perhap and present he see him fallen from hi high estat the victim of inform dy in prison or exil or by the hand of the execution the lesson which he thu receiv make him cautiou he leav polit repress hi pride and save penc avaric is enthron as hi bosom lord and assum the style of the great king the ration and spirit element sit humbl on the ground at either side the on immers in calcul the other absorb in the admir of wealth the love of honour turn to love of monei the convers is instantan the man is mean save toil the slave of on passion which is the master of the rest is he not the veri imag of the state he ha had no educ or he would never have allow the blind god of rich to lead the danc within him and be uneduc he will have mani slavish desir some beggarli some knavish breed in hi soul if he is the truste of an orphan and ha the power to defraud he will soon prove that he is not without the will and that hi passion ar onli restrain by fear and not by reason henc he lead a divid exist in which the better desir mostli prevail but when he is contend for prize and other distinct he is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid onli by barren honour in time of war he fight with a small part of hi resourc and usual keep hi monei and lose the victori next come democraci and the democrat man out of oligarchi and the oligarch man insati avaric is the rule passion of an oligarchi and thei encourag expens habit in order that thei mai gain by the ruin of extravag youth thu men of famili often lose their properti or right of citizenship but thei remain in the citi full of hatr against the new owner of their estat and ripe for revolut the usur with stoop walk pretend not to see them he pass by and leav hi stingthat is hi moneyin some other victim and mani a man ha to pai the parent or princip sum multipli into a famili of children and is reduc into a state of dronag by him the onli wai of diminish the evil is either to limit a man in hi us of hi properti or to insist that he shall lend at hi own risk but the rule class do not want remedi thei care onli for monei and ar as careless of virtu as the poorest of the citizen now there ar occas on which the governor and the govern meet togetherat festiv on a journei voyag or fight the sturdi pauper find that in the hour of danger he is not despis he see the rich man puf and pant and draw the conclus which he privat impart to hi companionsthat our peopl ar not good for much and as a sickli frame is made ill by a mere touch from without or sometim without extern impuls is readi to fall to piec of itself so from the least caus or with none at all the citi fall ill and fight a battl for life or death and democraci come into power when the poor ar the victor kill some and exil some and give equal share in the govern to all the rest the manner of life in such a state is that of democrat there is freedom and plain of speech and everi man doe what is right in hi own ey and ha hi own wai of life henc aris the most variou develop of charact the state is like a piec of embroideri of which the colour and figur ar the manner of men and there ar mani who like women and children prefer thi varieti to real beauti and excel the state is not on but mani like a bazaar at which you can bui anyth the great charm is that you mai do as you like you mai govern if you like let it alon if you like go to war and make peac if you feel dispos and all quit irrespect of anybodi els when you condemn men to death thei remain aliv all the same a gentleman is desir to go into exil and he stalk about the street like a hero and nobodi see him or care for him observ too how grandli democraci set her foot upon all our fine theori of educationhow littl she care for the train of her statesmen the onli qualif which she demand is the profess of patriot such is democracya pleas lawless variou sort of govern distribut equal to equal and unequ alik let us now inspect the individu democrat and first as in the case of the state we will trace hi anteced he is the son of a miserli oligarch and ha been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessari pleasur perhap i ought to explain thi latter termnecessari pleasur ar those which ar good and which we cannot do without unnecessari pleasur ar those which do no good and of which the desir might be erad by earli train for exampl the pleasur of eat and drink ar necessari and healthi up to a certain point beyond that point thei ar alik hurt to bodi and mind and the excess mai be avoid when in excess thei mai be rightli call expens pleasur in opposit to the us on and the drone as we call him is the slave of these unnecessari pleasur and desir wherea the miserli oligarch is subject onli to the necessari the oligarch chang into the democrat in the follow mannerth youth who ha had a miserli bring up get a tast of the drone honei he meet with wild companion who introduc him to everi new pleasur as in the state so in the individu there ar alli on both side temptat from without and passion from within there is reason also and extern influenc of parent and friend in allianc with the oligarch principl and the two faction ar in violent conflict with on anoth sometim the parti of order prevail but then again new desir and new disord aris and the whole mob of passion get possess of the acropoli that is to sai the soul which thei find void and unguard by true word and work falsehood and illus ascend to take their place the prodig goe back into the countri of the lotophagi or drone and openli dwell there and if ani offer of allianc or parlei of individu elder come from home the fals spirit shut the gate of the castl and permit no on to enterther is a battl and thei gain the victori and straightwai make allianc with the desir thei banish modesti which thei call folli and send temper over the border when the hous ha been swept and garnish thei dress up the exil vice and crown them with garland bring them back under new name insol thei call good breed anarchi freedom wast magnific impud courag such is the process by which the youth pass from the necessari pleasur to the unnecessari after a while he divid hi time imparti between them and perhap when he get older and the violenc of passion ha abat he restor some of the exil and live in a sort of equilibrium indulg first on pleasur and then anoth and if reason come and tell him that some pleasur ar good and honour and other bad and vile he shake hi head and sai that he can make no distinct between them thu he live in the fanci of the hour sometim he take to drink and then he turn abstain he practis in the gymnasium or he doe noth at all then again he would be a philosoph or a politician or again he would be a warrior or a man of busi he is everi thing by start and noth long there remain still the finest and fairest of all men and all statestyranni and the tyrant tyranni spring from democraci much as democraci spring from oligarchi both aris from excess the on from excess of wealth the other from excess of freedom the great natur good of life sai the democrat is freedom and thi exclus love of freedom and regardless of everyth els is the caus of the chang from democraci to tyranni the state demand the strong wine of freedom and unless her ruler give her a plenti draught punish and insult them equal and fratern of governor and govern is the approv principl anarchi is the law not of the state onli but of privat hous and extend even to the anim father and son citizen and foreign teacher and pupil old and young ar all on a level father and teacher fear their son and pupil and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder and the old imit the jaunti manner of the young becaus thei ar afraid of be thought moros slave ar on a level with their master and mistress and there is no differ between men and women nai the veri anim in a democrat state have a freedom which is unknown in other place the shedog ar as good as their shemistress and hors and ass march along with digniti and run their nose against anybodi who come in their wai that ha often been my experi at last the citizen becom so sensit that thei cannot endur the yoke of law written or unwritten thei would have no man call himself their master such is the gloriou begin of thing out of which tyranni spring gloriou inde but what is to follow the ruin of oligarchi is the ruin of democraci for there is a law of contrari the excess of freedom pass into the excess of slaveri and the greater the freedom the greater the slaveri you will rememb that in the oligarchi were found two classesrogu and pauper whom we compar to drone with and without sting these two class ar to the state what phlegm and bile ar to the human bodi and the statephysician or legisl must get rid of them just as the beemast keep the drone out of the hive now in a democraci too there ar drone but thei ar more numer and more danger than in the oligarchi there thei ar inert and unpractis here thei ar full of life and anim and the keener sort speak and act while the other buzz about the bema and prevent their oppon from be heard and there is anoth class in democrat state of respect thrive individu who can be squeez when the drone have need of their possess there is moreov a third class who ar the labour and the artisan and thei make up the mass of the peopl when the peopl meet thei ar omnipot but thei cannot be brought togeth unless thei ar attract by a littl honei and the rich ar made to suppli the honei of which the demagogu keep the greater part themselv give a tast onli to the mob their victim attempt to resist thei ar driven mad by the sting of the drone and so becom downright oligarch in selfdef then follow inform and convict for treason the peopl have some protector whom thei nurs into great and from thi root the tree of tyranni spring the natur of the chang is indic in the old fabl of the templ of zeu lycaeu which tell how he who tast human flesh mix up with the flesh of other victim will turn into a wolf even so the protector who tast human blood and slai some and exil other with or without law who hint at abolit of debt and divis of land must either perish or becom a wolfthat is a tyrant perhap he is driven out but he soon come back from exil and then if hi enemi cannot get rid of him by law mean thei plot hi assassin thereupon the friend of the peopl make hi wellknown request to them for a bodyguard which thei readili grant think onli of hi danger and not of their own now let the rich man make to himself wing for he will never run awai again if he doe not do so then and the great protector have crush all hi rival stand proudli erect in the chariot of state a fullblown tyrant let us enquir into the natur of hi happi in the earli dai of hi tyranni he smile and beam upon everybodi he is not a dominu no not he he ha onli come to put an end to debt and the monopoli of land have got rid of foreign enemi he make himself necessari to the state by alwai go to war he is thu enabl to depress the poor by heavi tax and so keep them at work and he can get rid of bolder spirit by hand them over to the enemi then come unpopular some of hi old associ have the courag to oppos him the consequ is that he ha to make a purgat of the state but unlik the physician who purg awai the bad he must get rid of the highspirit the wise and the wealthi for he ha no choic between death and a life of shame and dishonour and the more hate he is the more he will requir trusti guard but how will he obtain them thei will come flock like birdsfor pai will he not rather obtain them on the spot he will take the slave from their owner and make them hi bodyguard these ar hi trust friend who admir and look up to him ar not the tragic poet wise who magnifi and exalt the tyrant and sai that he is wise by associ with the wise and ar not their prais of tyranni alon a suffici reason why we should exclud them from our state thei mai go to other citi and gather the mob about them with fine word and chang commonwealth into tyranni and democraci receiv honour and reward for their servic but the higher thei and their friend ascend constitut hill the more their honour will fail and becom too asthmat to mount to return to the tyranthow will he support that rare armi of hi first by rob the templ of their treasur which will enabl him to lighten the tax then he will take all hi father properti and spend it on hi companion male or femal now hi father is the demu and if the demu get angri and sai that a great hulk son ought not to be a burden on hi parent and bid him and hi riotou crew begon then will the parent know what a monster he ha been nurtur and that the son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him you do not mean to sai that he will beat hi father ye he will after have taken awai hi arm then he is a parricid and a cruel unnatur son and the peopl have jump from the fear of slaveri into slaveri out of the smoke into the fire thu liberti when out of all order and reason pass into the worst form of servitud in the previou book plato ha describ the ideal state now he return to the pervert or declin form on which he had lightli touch at the end of book iv these he describ in a success of parallel between the individu and the state trace the origin of either in the state or individu which ha preced them he begin by ask the point at which he digress and is thu led shortli to recapitul the substanc of the three former book which also contain a parallel of the philosoph and the state of the first declin he give no intellig account he would not have like to admit the most probabl caus of the fall of hi ideal state which to us would appear to be the impractic of commun or the natur antagon of the rule and subject class he throw a veil of mysteri over the origin of the declin which he attribut to ignor of the law of popul of thi law the famou geometr figur or number is the express like the ancient in gener he had no idea of the gradual perfect of man or of the educ of the human race hi ideal wa not to be attain in the cours of ag but wa to spring in full armour from the head of the legisl when good law had been given he thought onli of the manner in which thei were like to be corrupt or of how thei might be fill up in detail or restor in accord with their origin spirit he appear not to have reflect upon the full mean of hi own word in the brief space of human life noth great can be accomplish or again as he afterward sai in the law infinit time is the maker of citi the order of constitut which is adopt by him repres an order of thought rather than a success of time and mai be consid as the first attempt to frame a philosophi of histori the first of these declin state is timocraci or the govern of soldier and lover of honour which answer to the spartan state thi is a govern of forc in which educ is not inspir by the muse but impos by the law and in which all the finer element of organ have disappear the philosoph himself ha lost the love of truth and the soldier who is of a simpler and honest natur rule in hi stead the individu who answer to timocraci ha some notic qualiti he is describ as ill educ but like the spartan a lover of literatur and although he is a harsh master to hi servant he ha no natur superior over them hi charact is base upon a reaction against the circumst of hi father who in a troubl citi ha retir from polit and hi mother who is dissatisfi at her own posit is alwai urg him toward the life of polit ambit such a charact mai have had thi origin and inde livi attribut the licinian law to a feminin jealousi of a similar kind but there is obvious no connect between the manner in which the timocrat state spring out of the ideal and the mere accid by which the timocrat man is the son of a retir statesman the two next stage in the declin of constitut have even less histor foundat for there is no trace in greek histori of a politi like the spartan or cretan pass into an oligarchi of wealth or of the oligarchi of wealth pass into a democraci the order of histori appear to be differ first in the homer time there is the royal or patriarch form of govern which a centuri or two later wa succeed by an oligarchi of birth rather than of wealth and in which wealth wa onli the accid of the hereditari possess of land and power sometim thi oligarch govern gave wai to a govern base upon a qualif of properti which accord to aristotl mode of us word would have been call a timocraci and thi in some citi as at athen becam the conduct medium to democraci but such wa not the necessari order of success in state nor inde can ani order be discern in the endless fluctuat of greek histori like the tide in the euripu except perhap in the almost uniform tendenc from monarchi to aristocraci in the earliest time at first sight there appear to be a similar invers in the last step of the platon success for tyranni instead of be the natur end of democraci in earli greek histori appear rather as a stage lead to democraci the reign of peisistratu and hi son is an episod which come between the legisl of solon and the constitut of cleisthen and some secret caus common to them all seem to have led the greater part of hella at her first appear in the dawn of histori eg athen argo corinth sicyon and nearli everi state with the except of sparta through a similar stage of tyranni which end either in oligarchi or democraci but then we must rememb that plato is describ rather the contemporari govern of the sicilian state which altern between democraci and tyranni than the ancient histori of athen or corinth the portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later greek delight to draw of phalari and dionysiu in which as in the live of mediaev saint or mythic hero the conduct and action of on were attribut to anoth in order to fill up the outlin there wa no enorm which the greek wa not todai to believ of them the tyrant wa the negat of govern and law hi assassin wa gloriou there wa no crime howev unnatur which might not with probabl be attribut to him in thi plato wa onli follow the common thought of hi countrymen which he embellish and exagger with all the power of hi geniu there is no need to suppos that he drew from life or that hi knowledg of tyrant is deriv from a person acquaint with dionysiu the manner in which he speak of them would rather tend to render doubt hi ever have consort with them or entertain the scheme which ar attribut to him in the epistl of regener sicili by their help plato in a hyperbol and seriocom vein exagger the folli of democraci which he also see reflect in social life to him democraci is a state of individu or dissolut in which everi on is do what is right in hi own ey of a peopl anim by a common spirit of liberti rise as on man to repel the persian host which is the lead idea of democraci in herodotu and thucydid he never seem to think but if he is not a believ in liberti still less is he a lover of tyranni hi deeper and more seriou condemn is reserv for the tyrant who is the ideal of wicked and also of weak and who in hi utter helpless and suspici is lead an almost imposs exist without that remnant of good which in plato opinion wa requir to give power to evil book i thi ideal of wicked live in helpless miseri is the revers of that other portrait of perfect injustic rule in happi and splendour which first of all thrasymachu and afterward the son of ariston had drawn and is also the revers of the king whose rule of life is the good of hi subject each of these govern and individu ha a correspond ethic gradat the ideal state is under the rule of reason not extinguish but harmon the passion and train them in virtu in the timocraci and the timocrat man the constitut whether of the state or of the individu is base first upon courag and secondli upon the love of honour thi latter virtu which is hardli to be esteem a virtu ha supersed all the rest in the second stage of declin the virtu have altogeth disappear and the love of gain ha succeed to them in the third stage or democraci the variou passion ar allow to have free plai and the virtu and vice ar imparti cultiv but thi freedom which lead to mani curiou extravag of charact is in realiti onli a state of weak and dissip at last on monster passion take possess of the whole natur of manthi is tyranni in all of them excessth excess first of wealth and then of freedom is the element of decai the eighth book of the republ abound in pictur of life and fanci allus the us of metaphor languag is carri to a greater extent than anywher els in plato we mai remark the descript of the two nation in on which becom more and more divid in the greek republ as in feudal time and perhap also in our own the notion of democraci express in a sort of pythagorean formula as equal among unequ the free and easi wai of men and anim which ar characterist of liberti as foreign mercenari and univers mistrust ar of the tyrant the propos that mere debt should not be recover by law is a specul which ha often been entertain by reform of the law in modern time and is in harmoni with the tendenc of modern legisl debt and land were the two great difficulti of the ancient lawgiv in modern time we mai be said to have almost if not quit solv the first of these difficulti but hardli the second still more remark ar the correspond portrait of individu there is the famili pictur of the father and mother and the old servant of the timocrat man and the outward respect and inher mean of the oligarch the uncontrol licenc and freedom of the democrat in which the young alcibiad seem to be depict do right or wrong as he pleas and who at last like the prodig goe into a far countri note here the plai of languag by which the democrat man is himself repres under the imag of a state have a citadel and receiv embassi and there is the wildbeast natur which break loos in hi successor the hit about the tyrant be a parricid the represent of the tyrant life as an obscen dream the rhetor surpris of a more miser than the most miser of men in book ix the hint to the poet that if thei ar the friend of tyrant there is no place for them in a constitut state and that thei ar too clever not to see the proprieti of their own expuls the continu imag of the drone who ar of two kind swell at last into the monster drone have wing book ixar among plato happiest touch there remain to be consid the great difficulti of thi book of the republ the socal number of the state thi is a puzzl almost as great as the number of the beast in the book of revel and though appar known to aristotl is refer to by cicero as a proverb of obscur ep ad att and some have imagin that there is no answer to the puzzl and that plato ha been practis upon hi reader but such a decept as thi is inconsist with the manner in which aristotl speak of the number pol and would have been ridicul to ani reader of the republ who wa acquaint with greek mathemat as littl reason is there for suppos that plato intention us obscur express the obscur aris from our want of familiar with the subject on the other hand plato himself indic that he is not altogeth seriou and in describ hi number as a solemn jest of the muse he appear to impli some degre of satir on the symbol us of number compar cratylu protag our hope of understand the passag depend princip on an accur studi of the word themselv on which a faint light is thrown by the parallel passag in the ninth book anoth help is the allus in aristotl who make the import remark that the latter part of the passag greek describ a solid figur polh onli sai that noth is abid but that all thing chang in a certain cycl and that the origin of the chang is a base of number which ar in the ratio of and thi when combin with a figur of five give two harmoni he mean when the number of thi figur becom solid some further clue mai be gather from the appear of the pythagorean triangl which is denot by the number and in which as in everi rightangl triangl the squar of the two lesser side equal the squar of the hypotenus plato begin by speak of a perfect or cyclic number tim ie a number in which the sum of the divisor equal the whole thi is the divin or perfect number in which all lesser cycl or revolut ar complet he also speak of a human or imperfect number have four term and three interv of number which ar relat to on anoth in certain proport these he convert into figur and find in them when thei have been rais to the third power certain element of number which give two harmoni the on squar the other oblong but he doe not sai that the squar number answer to the divin or the oblong number to the human cycl nor is ani intim given that the first or divin number repres the period of the world the second the period of the state or of the human race as zeller suppos nor is the divin number afterward mention arist the second is the number of gener or birth and presid over them in the same mysteri manner in which the star presid over them or in which accord to the pythagorean opportun justic marriag ar repres by some number or figur thi is probabl the number the explan given in the text suppos the two harmoni to make up the number thi explan deriv a certain plausibl from the circumst that is the ancient number of the spartan citizen herod and would be what plato might have call a number which nearli concern the popul of a citi the mysteri disappear of the spartan popul mai possibl have suggest to him the first caus of hi declin of state the lesser or squar harmoni of might be a symbol of the guardiansth larger or oblong harmoni of the peopl and the number might refer respect to the three order in the state or part of the soul the four virtu the five form of govern the harmoni of the music scale which is elsewher us as a symbol of the harmoni of the state is also indic for the number which repres the side of the pythagorean triangl also denot the interv of the scale the term us in the statement of the problem mai be explain as follow a perfect number greek as alreadi state is on which is equal to the sum of it divisor thu which is the first perfect or cyclic number the word greek term or note and greek interv ar applic to music as well as to number and figur greek is the base on which the whole calcul depend or the lowest term from which it can be work out the word greek have been various translatedsquar and cube donaldson equal and equal in power weber by involut and evolut ie by rais the power and extract the root as in the translat number ar call like and unlik greek when the factor or the side of the plane and cube which thei repres ar or ar not in the same ratio eg and cube and cube and convers wax greek number call also increas greek ar those which ar exceed by the sum of their divisor eg and ar less than and wane greek number call also decreas greek ar those which succe the sum of their divisor eg and exce and the word translat commensur and agreeabl to on anoth greek seem to be differ wai of describ the same relat with more or less precis thei ar equival to express in term have the same relat to on anoth like the seri each of which number is in the relat of and to the preced the base or fundament number which ha ad to it and or a music fourth greek is a proport of number as of music note appli either to the part or factor of a singl number or to the relat of on number to anoth the first harmoni is a squar number greek the second harmoni is an oblong number greek ie a number repres a figur of which the opposit side onli ar equal greek number squar from or upon diamet greek ration ie omit fraction greek irrat ie includ fraction eg is a squar of the ration diamet of a figur the side of which of an irrat diamet of the same for sever of the explan here given and for a good deal besid i am indebt to an excel articl on the platon number by dr donaldson proc of the philol societi the conclus which he draw from these data ar sum up by him as follow have assum that the number of the perfect or divin cycl is the number of the world and the number of the imperfect cycl the number of the state he proce the period of the world is defin by the perfect number that of the state by the cube of that number or which is the product of the last pair of term in the platon tetracti a seri of seven term and if we take thi as the basi of our comput we shall have two cube number greek viz and and the mean proport between these viz and will furnish three interv and four term and these term and interv stand relat to on anoth in the sesquialtera ratio ie each term is to the preced as now if we rememb that the number x cube cube cube and squar squar squar we must admit that thi number impli the number to which musician attach so much import and if we combin the ratio with the number or multipli the ratio of the side by the hypotenus we shall by first squar and then cube obtain two express which denot the ratio of the two last pair of term in the platon tetracti the former multipli by the squar the latter by the cube of the number the sum of the first four digit which constitut the platon tetracti the two greek he elsewher explain as follow the first greek is greek in other word x all squar x squar over squar the second greek a cube of the same root is describ as multipli alpha by the ration diamet of diminish by uniti ie as shown abov beta by two incommensur diamet ie the two first irrat or and and gamma by the cube of or thu we have x cube thi second harmoni is to be the cube of the number of which the former harmoni is the squar and therefor must be divid by the cube of in other word the whole express will be for the first harmoni for the second harmoni the reason which have inclin me to agre with dr donaldson and also with schleiermach in suppos that is the platon number of birth ar that it coincid with the descript of the number given in the first part of the passag greek that the number with it permut would have been familiar to a greek mathematician though unfamiliar to us that is the cube of and also the sum of cube cube cube the number repres the pythagorean triangl of which the side when squar equal the squar of the hypotenus that it is also the period of the pythagorean metempsychosi the three ultim term or base of which is compos answer to the third fourth fifth in the music scale that the number is the product of the cube of and which ar the two last term in the platon tetracti that the pythagorean triangl is said by plutarch de is et osir proclu super prima eucl and quintilian de musica to be contain in thi passag so that the tradit of the school seem to point in the same direct that the pythagorean triangl is call also the figur of marriag greek but though agre with dr donaldson thu far i see no reason for suppos as he doe that the first or perfect number is the world the human or imperfect number the state nor ha he given ani proof that the second harmoni is a cube nor do i think that greek can mean two incommensur which he arbitrarili assum to be and but rather as the preced claus impli greek ie two squar number base upon irrat diamet of a figur the side of which is x the greatest object to the translat is the sens given to the word greek a base of three with a third ad to it multipli by in thi somewhat forc manner plato introduc onc more the number of the pythagorean triangl but the coincid in the number which follow ar in favour of the explan the first harmoni of as ha been alreadi remark probabl repres the ruler the second and oblong harmoni of the peopl and here we take leav of the difficulti the discoveri of the riddl would be useless and would throw no light on ancient mathemat the point of interest is that plato should have us such a symbol and that so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevail in him hi gener mean is that divin creation is perfect and is repres or presid over by a perfect or cyclic number human gener is imperfect and repres or presid over by an imperfect number or seri of number the number which is the number of the citizen in the law is expressli base by him on utilitarian ground name the conveni of the number for divis it is also made up of the first seven digit multipli by on anoth the contrast of the perfect and imperfect number mai have been easili suggest by the correct of the cycl which were made first by meton and secondli by callippu the latter is said to have been a pupil of plato of the degre of import or of exact to be attribut to the problem the number of the tyrant in book ix x and the slight correct of the error in the number law mai furnish a criterion there is noth surpris in the circumst that those who were seek for order in natur and had found order in number should have imagin on to give law to the other plato believ in a power of number far beyond what he could see realiz in the world around him and he know the great influenc which the littl matter of exercis upon educ he mai even be thought to have a prophet anticip of the discoveri of quetelet and other that number depend upon number egin popul the number of birth and the respect number of children born of either sex on the respect ag of parent ie on other number book ix last of all come the tyrann man about whom we have to enquir whenc is he and how doe he livein happi or in miseri there is howev a previou question of the natur and number of the appetit which i should like to consid first some of them ar unlaw and yet admit of be chasten and weaken in variou degre by the power of reason and law what appetit do you mean i mean those which ar awak when the reason power ar asleep which get up and walk about nake without ani selfrespect or shame and there is no conceiv folli or crime howev cruel or unnatur of which in imagin thei mai not be guilti true he said veri true but when a man puls beat temper and he ha sup on a feast of reason and come to a knowledg of himself befor go to rest and ha satisfi hi desir just enough to prevent their perturb hi reason which remain clear and lumin and when he is free from quarrel and heatth vision which he ha on hi bed ar least irregular and abnorm even in good men there is such an irregular wildbeast natur which peer out in sleep to returny rememb what wa said of the democrat that he wa the son of a miserli father who encourag the save desir and repress the ornament and expens on present the youth got into fine compani and began to entertain a dislik to hi father narrow wai and be a better man than the corrupt of hi youth he came to a mean and led a life not of lawless or slavish passion but of regular and success indulg now imagin that the youth ha becom a father and ha a son who is expos to the same temptat and ha companion who lead him into everi sort of iniqu and parent and friend who try to keep him right the counsellor of evil find that their onli chanc of retain him is to implant in hi soul a monster drone or love while other desir buzz around him and mystifi him with sweet sound and scent thi monster love take possess of him and put an end to everi true or modest thought or wish love like drunken and mad is a tyranni and the tyrann man whether made by natur or habit is just a drink lust furiou sort of anim and how doe such an on live nai that you must tell me well then i fanci that he will live amid revelri and harlotri and love will be the lord and master of the hous mani desir requir much monei and so he spend all that he ha and borrow more and when he ha noth the young raven ar still in the nest in which thei were hatch cry for food love urg them on and thei must be gratifi by forc or fraud or if not thei becom pain and troublesom and as the new pleasur succe the old on so will the son take possess of the good of hi parent if thei show sign of refus he will defraud and deceiv them and if thei openli resist what then i can onli sai that i should not much like to be in their place but o heaven adeimantu to think that for some newfangl and unnecessari love he will give up hi old father and mother best and dearest of friend or enslav them to the fanci of the hour truli a tyrann son is a bless to hi father and mother when there is no more to be got out of them he turn burglar or pickpocket or rob a templ love overmast the thought of hi youth and he becom in sober realiti the monster that he wa sometim in sleep he wax strong in all violenc and lawless and is readi for ani deed of dare that will suppli the want of hi rabblerout in a wellord state there ar onli a few such and these in time of war go out and becom the mercenari of a tyrant but in time of peac thei stai at home and do mischief thei ar the thiev footpad cutpurs mansteal of the commun or if thei ar abl to speak thei turn falsewit and inform no small catalogu of crime truli even if the perpetr ar few ye i said but small and great ar rel term and no crime which ar commit by them approach those of the tyrant whom thi class grow strong and numer creat out of themselv if the peopl yield well and good but if thei resist then as befor he beat hi father and mother so now he beat hi fatherland and motherland and place hi mercenari over them such men in their earli dai live with flatter and thei themselv flatter other in order to gain their end but thei soon discard their follow when thei have no longer ani need of them thei ar alwai either master or servantsth joi of friendship ar unknown to them and thei ar utterli treacher and unjust if the natur of justic be at all understood by us thei realiz our dream and he who is the most of a tyrant by natur and lead the life of a tyrant for the longest time will be the worst of them and be the worst of them will also be the most miser like man like stateth tyrann man will answer to tyranni which is the extrem opposit of the royal state for on is the best and the other the worst but which is the happier great and terribl as the tyrant mai appear enthron amid hi satellit let us not be afraid to go in and ask and the answer is that the monarch is the happiest and the tyrann the most miser of state and mai we not ask the same question about the men themselv request some on to look into them who is abl to penetr the inner natur of man and will not be panicstruck by the vain pomp of tyranni i will suppos that he is on who ha live with him and ha seen him in famili life or perhap in the hour of troubl and danger assum that we ourselv ar the imparti judg for whom we seek let us begin by compar the individu and state and ask first of all whether the state is like to be free or enslavedwil there not be a littl freedom and a great deal of slaveri and the freedom is of the bad and the slaveri of the good and thi appli to the man as well as to the state for hi soul is full of mean and slaveri and the better part is enslav to the wors he cannot do what he would and hi mind is full of confus he is the veri revers of a freeman the state will be poor and full of miseri and sorrow and the man soul will also be poor and full of sorrow and he will be the most miser of men no not the most miser for there is yet a more miser who is that the tyrann man who ha the misfortun also to becom a public tyrant there i suspect that you ar right sai rather i am sure conjectur is out of place in an enquiri of thi natur he is like a wealthi owner of slave onli he ha more of them than ani privat individu you will sai the owner of slave ar not gener in ani fear of them but why becaus the whole citi is in a leagu which protect the individu suppos howev that on of these owner and hi household is carri off by a god into a wilder where there ar no freemen to help himwil he not be in an agoni of terrorwil he not be compel to flatter hi slave and to promis them mani thing sore against hi will and suppos the same god who carri him off were to surround him with neighbour who declar that no man ought to have slave and that the owner of them should be punish with death still wors and wors he will be in the midst of hi enemi and is not our tyrant such a captiv soul who is torment by a swarm of passion which he cannot indulg live indoor alwai like a woman and jealou of those who can go out and see the world have so mani evil will not the most miser of men be still more miser in a public station master of other when he is not master of himself like a sick man who is compel to be an athlet the meanest of slave and the most abject of flatter want all thing and never abl to satisfi hi desir alwai in fear and distract like the state of which he is the repres hi jealou hate faithless temper grow wors with command he is more and more faithless enviou unrighteousth most wretch of men a miseri to himself and to other and so let us have a final trial and proclam need we hire a herald or shall i proclaim the result made the proclam yourself the son of ariston the best is of opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest and that thi is he who is the most royal master of himself and that the unjust man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of hi state and i add furtherseen or unseen by god or men thi is our first proof the second is deriv from the three kind of pleasur which answer to the three element of the soulreason passion desir under which last is comprehend avaric as well as sensual appetit while passion includ ambit partyfeel love of reput reason again is sole direct to the attain of truth and careless of monei and reput in accord with the differ of men natur on of these three principl is in the ascend and thei have their sever pleasur correspond to them interrog now the three natur and each on will be found prais hi own pleasur and depreci those of other the moneymak will contrast the vaniti of knowledg with the solid advantag of wealth the ambiti man will despis knowledg which bring no honour wherea the philosoph will regard onli the fruition of truth and will call other pleasur necessari rather than good now how shall we decid between them is there ani better criterion than experi and knowledg and which of the three ha the truest knowledg and the widest experi the experi of youth make the philosoph acquaint with the two kind of desir but the avarici and the ambiti man never tast the pleasur of truth and wisdom honour he ha equal with them thei ar judg of him but he is not judg of them for thei never attain to the knowledg of true be and hi instrument is reason wherea their standard is onli wealth and honour and if by reason we ar to judg hi good will be the truest and so we arriv at the result that the pleasur of the ration part of the soul and a life pass in such pleasur is the pleasantest he who ha a right to judg judg thu next come the life of ambit and in the third place that of moneymak twice ha the just man overthrown the unjustonc more as in an olympian contest first offer up a prayer to the saviour zeu let him try a fall a wise man whisper to me that the pleasur of the wise ar true and pure all other ar a shadow onli let us examin thi is not pleasur oppos to pain and is there not a mean state which is neither when a man is sick noth is more pleasant to him than health but thi he never found out while he wa well in pain he desir onli to ceas from pain on the other hand when he is in an ecstasi of pleasur rest is pain to him thu rest or cessat is both pleasur and pain but can that which is neither becom both again pleasur and pain ar motion and the absenc of them is rest but if so how can the absenc of either of them be the other thu we ar led to infer that the contradict is an appear onli and witcheri of the sens and these ar not the onli pleasur for there ar other which have no preced pain pure pleasur then is not the absenc of pain nor pure pain the absenc of pleasur although most of the pleasur which reach the mind through the bodi ar relief of pain and have not onli their reaction when thei depart but their anticip befor thei come thei can be best describ in a simil there is in natur an upper lower and middl region and he who pass from the lower to the middl imagin that he is go up and is alreadi in the upper world and if he were taken back again would think and truli think that he wa descend all thi aris out of hi ignor of the true upper middl and lower region and a like confus happen with pleasur and pain and with mani other thing the man who compar grei with black call grei white and the man who compar absenc of pain with pain call the absenc of pain pleasur again hunger and thirst ar inanit of the bodi ignor and folli of the soul and food is the satisfact of the on knowledg of the other now which is the purer satisfactionthat of eat and drink or that of knowledg consid the matter thu the satisfact of that which ha more exist is truer than of that which ha less the invari and immort ha a more real exist than the variabl and mortal and ha a correspond measur of knowledg and truth the soul again ha more exist and truth and knowledg than the bodi and is therefor more realli satisfi and ha a more natur pleasur those who feast onli on earthli food ar alwai go at random up to the middl and down again but thei never pass into the true upper world or have a tast of true pleasur thei ar like fat beast full of gluttoni and sensual and readi to kill on anoth by reason of their insati lust for thei ar not fill with true be and their vessel is leaki gorgia their pleasur ar mere shadow of pleasur mix with pain colour and intensifi by contrast and therefor intens desir and men go fight about them as stesichoru sai that the greek fought about the shadow of helen at troi becaus thei know not the truth the same mai be said of the passion elementth desir of the ambiti soul as well as of the covet have an inferior satisfact onli when under the guidanc of reason do either of the other principl do their own busi or attain the pleasur which is natur to them when not attain thei compel the other part of the soul to pursu a shadow of pleasur which is not their and the more distant thei ar from philosophi and reason the more distant thei will be from law and order and the more illus will be their pleasur the desir of love and tyranni ar the farthest from law and those of the king ar nearest to it there is on genuin pleasur and two spuriou on the tyrant goe beyond even the latter he ha run awai altogeth from law and reason nor can the measur of hi inferior be told except in a figur the tyrant is the third remov from the oligarch and ha therefor not a shadow of hi pleasur but the shadow of a shadow onli the oligarch again is thrice remov from the king and thu we get the formula x which is the number of a surfac repres the shadow which is the tyrant pleasur and if you like to cube thi number of the beast you will find that the measur of the differ amount to the king is time more happi than the tyrant and thi extraordinari number is nearli equal to the number of dai and night in a year x and is therefor concern with human life thi is the interv between a good and bad man in happi onli what must be the differ between them in comeli of life and virtu perhap you mai rememb some on sai at the begin of our discuss that the unjust man wa profit if he had the reput of justic now that we know the natur of justic and injustic let us make an imag of the soul which will personifi hi word first of all fashion a multitudin beast have a ring of head of all manner of anim tame and wild and abl to produc and chang them at pleasur suppos now anoth form of a lion and anoth of a man the second smaller than the first the third than the second join them togeth and cover them with a human skin in which thei ar complet conceal when thi ha been done let us tell the support of injustic that he is feed up the beast and starv the man the maintain of justic on the other hand is try to strengthen the man he is nourish the gentl principl within him and make an allianc with the lion heart in order that he mai be abl to keep down the manyhead hydra and bring all into uniti with each other and with themselv thu in everi point of view whether in relat to pleasur honour or advantag the just man is right and the unjust wrong but now let us reason with the unjust who is not intention in error is not the nobl that which subject the beast to the man or rather to the god in man the ignobl that which subject the man to the beast and if so who would receiv gold on condit that he wa to degrad the noblest part of himself under the worstwho would sell hi son or daughter into the hand of brutal and evil men for ani amount of monei and will he sell hi own fairer and divin part without ani compunct to the most godless and foul would he not be wors than eriphyl who sold her husband life for a necklac and intemper is the let loos of the multiform monster and pride and sullen ar the growth and increas of the lion and serpent element while luxuri and effeminaci ar caus by a too great relax of spirit flatteri and mean again aris when the spirit element is subject to avaric and the lion is habitu to becom a monkei the real disgrac of handicraft art is that those who ar engag in them have to flatter instead of master their desir therefor we sai that thei should be place under the control of the better principl in anoth becaus thei have none in themselv not as thrasymachu imagin to the injuri of the subject but for their good and our intent in educ the young is to give them selfcontrol the law desir to nurs up in them a higher principl and when thei have acquir thi thei mai go their wai what then shall a man profit if he gain the whole world and becom more and more wick or what shall he profit by escap discoveri if the conceal of evil prevent the cure if he had been punish the brute within him would have been silenc and the gentler element liber and he would have unit temper justic and wisdom in hi soula union better far than ani combin of bodili gift the man of understand will honour knowledg abov all in the next place he will keep under hi bodi not onli for the sake of health and strength but in order to attain the most perfect harmoni of bodi and soul in the acquisit of rich too he will aim at order and harmoni he will not desir to heap up wealth without measur but he will fear that the increas of wealth will disturb the constitut of hi own soul for the same reason he will onli accept such honour as will make him a better man ani other he will declin in that case said he he will never be a politician ye but he will in hi own citi though probabl not in hi nativ countri unless by some divin accid you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal citi which ha no place upon earth but in heaven i repli there is a pattern of such a citi and he who wish mai order hi life after that imag whether such a state is or ever will be matter not he will act accord to that pattern and no other the most notic point in the th book of the republ ar the account of pleasur the number of the interv which divid the king from the tyrant the pattern which is in heaven plato account of pleasur is remark for moder and in thi respect contrast with the later platonist and the view which ar attribut to them by aristotl he is not like the cynic oppos to all pleasur but rather desir that the sever part of the soul shall have their natur satisfact he even agre with the epicurean in describ pleasur as someth more than the absenc of pain thi is prove by the circumst that there ar pleasur which have no anteced pain as he also remark in the philebu such as the pleasur of smell and also the pleasur of hope and anticip in the previou book he had made the distinct between necessari and unnecessari pleasur which is repeat by aristotl and he now observ that there ar a further class of wild beast pleasur correspond to aristotl greek he dwell upon the rel and unreal charact of sensual pleasur and the illus which aris out of the contrast of pleasur and pain point out the superior of the pleasur of reason which ar at rest over the fleet pleasur of sens and emot the preemin of royal pleasur is shown by the fact that reason is abl to form a judgment of the lower pleasur while the two lower part of the soul ar incap of judg the pleasur of reason thu in hi treatment of pleasur as in mani other subject the philosophi of plato is sawn up into quantiti by aristotl the analysi which wa origin made by him becam in the next gener the foundat of further technic distinct both in plato and aristotl we note the illus under which the ancient fell of regard the transienc of pleasur as a proof of it unreal and of confound the perman of the intellectu pleasur with the unchang of the knowledg from which thei ar deriv neither do we like to admit that the pleasur of knowledg though more elev ar not more last than other pleasur and ar almost equal depend on the accid of our bodili state introduct to philebu the number of the interv which separ the king from the tyrant and royal from tyrann pleasur is the cube of which plato characterist design as a number concern with human life becaus nearli equival to the number of dai and night in the year he is desir of proclaim that the interv between them is immeasur and invent a formula to give express to hi idea those who spoke of justic as a cube of virtu as an art of measur prot saw no inappropri in conceiv the soul under the figur of a line or the pleasur of the tyrant as separ from the pleasur of the king by the numer interv of and in modern time we sometim us metaphor what plato emploi as a philosoph formula it is not easi to estim the loss of the tyrant except perhap in thi wai sai plato so we might sai that although the life of a good man is not to be compar to that of a bad man yet you mai measur the differ between them by valu on minut of the on at an hour of the other on dai in thy court is better than a thousand or you might sai that there is an infinit differ but thi is not so much as sai in home phrase thei ar a thousand mile asund and accordingli plato find the natur vehicl of hi thought in a progress of number thi arithmet formula he draw out with the utmost serious and both here and in the number of gener seem to find an addit proof of the truth of hi specul in form the number into a geometr figur just as person in our own dai ar apt to fanci that a statement is verifi when it ha been onli thrown into an abstract form in speak of the number as proper to human life he probabl intend to intim that on year of the tyrann hour of the royal life the simpl observ that the comparison of two similar solid is effect by the comparison of the cube of their side is the mathemat groundwork of thi fanci express there is some difficulti in explain the step by which the number is obtain the oligarch is remov in the third degre from the royal and aristocrat and the tyrant in the third degre from the oligarch but we have to arrang the term as the side of a squar and to count the oligarch twice over thu reckon them not as but as the squar of is pass lightli over as onli a step toward the cube toward the close of the republ plato seem to be more and more convinc of the ideal charact of hi own specul at the end of the th book the pattern which is in heaven take the place of the citi of philosoph on earth the vision which ha receiv form and substanc at hi hand is now discov to be at a distanc and yet thi distant kingdom is also the rule of man life sai not lo here or lo there for the kingdom of god is within you thu a note is struck which prepar for the revel of a futur life in the follow book but the futur life is present still the ideal of polit is to be realiz in the individu book x mani thing pleas me in the order of our state but there wa noth which i like better than the regul about poetri the divis of the soul throw a new light on our exclus of imit i do not mind tell you in confid that all poetri is an outrag on the understand unless the hearer have that balm of knowledg which heal error i have love homer ever sinc i wa a boi and even now he appear to me to be the great master of tragic poetri but much as i love the man i love truth more and therefor i must speak out and first of all will you explain what is imit for realli i do not understand how like then that i should understand that might veri well be for the duller often see better than the keener ey true but in your presenc i can hardli ventur to sai what i think then suppos that we begin in our old fashion with the doctrin of univers let us assum the exist of bed and tabl there is on idea of a bed or of a tabl which the maker of each had in hi mind when make them he did not make the idea of bed and tabl but he made bed and tabl accord to the idea and is there not a maker of the work of all workmen who make not onli vessel but plant and anim himself the earth and heaven and thing in heaven and under the earth he make the god also he must be a wizard inde but do you not see that there is a sens in which you could do the same you have onli to take a mirror and catch the reflect of the sun and the earth or anyth elsether now you have made them ye but onli in appear exactli so and the painter is such a creator as you ar with the mirror and he is even more unreal than the carpent although neither the carpent nor ani other artist can be suppos to make the absolut bed not if philosoph mai be believ nor need we wonder that hi bed ha but an imperfect relat to the truth reflecther ar three bed on in natur which is made by god anoth which is made by the carpent and the third by the painter god onli made on nor could he have made more than on for if there had been two there would alwai have been a thirdmor absolut and abstract than either under which thei would have been includ we mai therefor conceiv god to be the natur maker of the bed and in a lower sens the carpent is also the maker but the painter is rather the imit of what the other two make he ha to do with a creation which is thrice remov from realiti and the tragic poet is an imit and like everi other imit is thrice remov from the king and from the truth the painter imit not the origin bed but the bed made by the carpent and thi without be realli differ appear to be differ and ha mani point of view of which onli on is caught by the painter who repres everyth becaus he repres a piec of everyth and that piec an imag and he can paint ani other artist although he know noth of their art and thi with suffici skill to deceiv children or simpl peopl suppos now that somebodi came to us and told us how he had met a man who knew all that everybodi know and better than anybodyshould we not infer him to be a simpleton who have no discern of truth and falsehood had met with a wizard or enchant whom he fanci to be allwis and when we hear person sai that homer and the tragedian know all the art and all the virtu must we not infer that thei ar under a similar delus thei do not see that the poet ar imit and that their creation ar onli imit veri true but if a person could creat as well as imit he would rather leav some perman work and not an imit onli he would rather be the receiv than the giver of prais ye for then he would have more honour and advantag let us now interrog homer and the poet friend homer sai i to him i am not go to ask you about medicin or ani art to which your poem incident refer but about their main subjectswar militari tactic polit if you ar onli twice and not thrice remov from the truthnot an imit or an imagemak pleas to inform us what good you have ever done to mankind is there ani citi which profess to have receiv law from you as sicili and itali have from charonda sparta from lycurgu athen from solon or wa ani war ever carri on by your counsel or is ani invent attribut to you as there is to thale and anacharsi or is there ani homer wai of life such as the pythagorean wa in which you instruct men and which is call after you no inde and creophylu fleshchild wa even more unfortun in hi breed than he wa in hi name if as tradit sai homer in hi lifetim wa allow by him and hi other friend to starv ye but could thi ever have happen if homer had realli been the educ of hella would he not have had mani devot follow if protagora and prodicu can persuad their contemporari that no on can manag hous or state without them is it like that homer and hesiod would have been allow to go about as beggarsi mean if thei had realli been abl to do the world ani goodwould not men have compel them to stai where thei were or have follow them about in order to get educ but thei did not and therefor we mai infer that homer and all the poet ar onli imit who do but imit the appear of thing for as a painter by a knowledg of figur and colour can paint a cobbler without ani practic in cobbl so the poet can delin ani art in the colour of languag and give harmoni and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the gener and you know how mere narrat when depriv of the ornament of metr is like a face which ha lost the beauti of youth and never had ani other onc more the imit ha no knowledg of realiti but onli of appear the painter paint and the artific make a bridl and rein but neither understand the us of themth knowledg of thi is confin to the horseman and so of other thing thu we have three art on of us anoth of invent a third of imit and the user furnish the rule to the two other the fluteplay will know the good and bad flute and the maker will put faith in him but the imit will neither know nor have faithneith scienc nor true opinion can be ascrib to him imit then is devoid of knowledg be onli a kind of plai or sport and the tragic and epic poet ar imit in the highest degre and now let us enquir what is the faculti in man which answer to imit allow me to explain my mean object ar differ seen when in the water and when out of the water when near and when at a distanc and the painter or juggler make us of thi variat to impos upon us and the art of measur and weigh and calcul come in to save our bewild mind from the power of appear for as we were sai two contrari opinion of the same about the same and at the same time cannot both of them be true but which of them is true is determin by the art of calcul and thi is alli to the better faculti in the soul as the art of imit ar to the wors and the same hold of the ear as well as of the ey of poetri as well as paint the imit is of action voluntari or involuntari in which there is an expect of a good or bad result and present experi of pleasur and pain but is a man in harmoni with himself when he is the subject of these conflict influenc is there not rather a contradict in him let me further ask whether he is more like to control sorrow when he is alon or when he is in compani in the latter case feel would lead him to indulg hi sorrow but reason and law control him and enjoin patienc sinc he cannot know whether hi afflict is good or evil and no human thing is of ani great consequ while sorrow is certainli a hindranc to good counsel for when we stumbl we should not like children make an uproar we should take the measur which reason prescrib not rais a lament but find a cure and the better part of us is readi to follow reason while the irrat principl is full of sorrow and distract at the recollect of our troubl unfortun howev thi latter furnish the chief materi of the imit art wherea reason is ever in repos and cannot easili be displai especi to a mix multitud who have no experi of her thu the poet is like the painter in two wai first he paint an inferior degre of truth and secondli he is concern with an inferior part of the soul he indulg the feel while he enfeebl the reason and we refus to allow him to have author over the mind of man for he ha no measur of greater and less and is a maker of imag and veri far gone from truth but we have not yet mention the heaviest count in the indictmentth power which poetri ha of injuri excit the feel when we hear some passag in which a hero lament hi suffer at tediou length you know that we sympath with him and prais the poet and yet in our own sorrow such an exhibit of feel is regard as effemin and unmanli ion now ought a man to feel pleasur in see anoth do what he hate and abomin in himself is he not give wai to a sentiment which in hi own case he would controlh is off hi guard becaus the sorrow is anoth and he think that he mai indulg hi feel without disgrac and will be the gainer by the pleasur but the inevit consequ is that he who begin by weep at the sorrow of other will end by weep at hi own the same is true of comedyy mai often laugh at buffooneri which you would be asham to utter and the love of coars merriment on the stage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home poetri feed and water the passion and desir she let them rule instead of rule them and therefor when we hear the encomiast of homer affirm that he is the educ of hella and that all life should be regul by hi precept we mai allow the excel of their intent and agre with them in think homer a great poet and tragedian but we shall continu to prohibit all poetri which goe beyond hymn to the god and prais of famou men not pleasur and pain but law and reason shall rule in our state these ar our ground for expel poetri but lest she should charg us with discourtesi let us also make an apolog to her we will remind her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetri and philosophi of which there ar mani trace in the write of the poet such as the sai of the shedog yelp at her mistress and the philosoph who ar readi to circumv zeu and the philosoph who ar pauper nevertheless we bear her no illwil and will gladli allow her to return upon condit that she make a defenc of herself in vers and her support who ar not poet mai speak in prose we confess her charm but if she cannot show that she is us as well as delight like ration lover we must renounc our love though endear to us by earli associ have come to year of discret we know that poetri is not truth and that a man should be care how he introduc her to that state or constitut which he himself is for there is a mighti issu at stakeno less than the good or evil of a human soul and it is not worth while to forsak justic and virtu for the attract of poetri ani more than for the sake of honour or wealth i agre with you and yet the reward of virtu ar greater far than i have describ and can we conceiv thing greater still not perhap in thi brief span of life but should an immort be care about anyth short of etern i do not understand what you mean do you not know that the soul is immort sure you ar not prepar to prove that inde i am then let me hear thi argument of which you make so light you would admit that everyth ha an element of good and of evil in all thing there is an inher corrupt and if thi cannot destroi them noth els will the soul too ha her own corrupt principl which ar injustic intemper cowardic and the like but none of these destroi the soul in the same sens that diseas destroi the bodi the soul mai be full of all iniqu but is not by reason of them brought ani nearer to death noth which wa not destroi from within ever perish by extern affect of evil the bodi which is on thing cannot be destroi by food which is anoth unless the bad of the food is commun to the bodi neither can the soul which is on thing be corrupt by the bodi which is anoth unless she herself is infect and as no bodili evil can infect the soul neither can ani bodili evil whether diseas or violenc or ani other destroi the soul unless it can be shown to render her unholi and unjust but no on will ever prove that the soul of men becom more unjust when thei die if a person ha the audac to sai the contrari the answer isthen why do crimin requir the hand of the execution and not die of themselv truli he said injustic would not be veri terribl if it brought a cessat of evil but i rather believ that the injustic which murder other mai tend to quicken and stimul the life of the unjust you ar quit right if sin which is her own natur and inher evil cannot destroi the soul hardli will anyth els destroi her but the soul which cannot be destroi either by intern or extern evil must be immort and everlast and if thi be true soul will alwai exist in the same number thei cannot diminish becaus thei cannot be destroi nor yet increas for the increas of the immort must come from someth mortal and so all would end in immort neither is the soul variabl and divers for that which is immort must be of the fairest and simplest composit if we would conceiv her truli and so behold justic and injustic in their own natur she must be view by the light of reason pure as at birth or as she is reflect in philosophi when hold convers with the divin and immort and etern in her present condit we see her onli like the seagod glaucu bruis and maim in the sea which is the world and cover with shell and stone which ar incrust upon her from the entertain of earth thu far as the argument requir we have said noth of the reward and honour which the poet attribut to justic we have content ourselv with show that justic in herself is best for the soul in herself even if a man should put on a gyge ring and have the helmet of hade too and now you shall repai me what you borrow and i will enumer the reward of justic in life and after death i grant for the sake of argument as you will rememb that evil might perhap escap the knowledg of god and men although thi wa realli imposs and sinc i have shown that justic ha realiti you must grant me also that she ha the palm of appear in the first place the just man is known to the god and he is therefor the friend of the god and he will receiv at their hand everi good alwai except such evil as is the necessari consequ of former sin all thing end in good to him either in life or after death even what appear to be evil for the god have a care of him who desir to be in their like and what shall we sai of men is not honesti the best polici the clever rogu make a great start at first but break down befor he reach the goal and slink awai in dishonour wherea the true runner persever to the end and receiv the prize and you must allow me to repeat all the bless which you attribut to the fortun unjustthei bear rule in the citi thei marri and give in marriag to whom thei will and the evil which you attribut to the unfortun just do realli fall in the end on the unjust although as you impli their suffer ar better veil in silenc but all the bless of thi present life ar as noth when compar with those which await good men after death i should like to hear about them come then and i will tell you the stori of er the son of armeniu a valiant man he wa suppos to have di in battl but ten dai afterward hi bodi wa found untouch by corrupt and sent home for burial on the twelfth dai he wa place on the funer pyre and there he came to life again and told what he had seen in the world below he said that hi soul went with a great compani to a place in which there were two chasm near togeth in the earth beneath and two correspond chasm in the heaven abov and there were judg sit in the intermedi space bid the just ascend by the heavenli wai on the right hand have the seal of their judgment set upon them befor while the unjust have the seal behind were bidden to descend by the wai on the left hand him thei told to look and listen as he wa to be their messeng to men from the world below and he beheld and saw the soul depart after judgment at either chasm some who came from earth were worn and travelstain other who came from heaven were clean and bright thei seem glad to meet and rest awhil in the meadow here thei discours with on anoth of what thei had seen in the other world those who came from earth wept at the remembr of their sorrow but the spirit from abov spoke of gloriou sight and heavenli bliss he said that for everi evil deed thei were punish tenfoldnow the journei wa of a thousand year durat becaus the life of man wa reckon as a hundr yearsand the reward of virtu were in the same proport he ad someth hardli worth repeat about infant dy almost as soon as thei were born of parricid and other murder he had tortur still more terribl to narrat he wa present when on of the spirit askedwher is ardiaeu the great thi ardiaeu wa a cruel tyrant who had murder hi father and hi elder brother a thousand year befor anoth spirit answer he come not hither and will never come and i myself he ad actual saw thi terribl sight at the entranc of the chasm as we were about to reascend ardiaeu appear and some other sinnersmost of whom had been tyrant but not alland just as thei fanci that thei were return to life the chasm gave a roar and then wild fierylook men who knew the mean of the sound seiz him and sever other and bound them hand and foot and threw them down and drag them along at the side of the road lacer them and card them like wool and explain to the passersbi that thei were go to be cast into hell the greatest terror of the pilgrim ascend wa lest thei should hear the voic and when there wa silenc on by on thei pass up with joi to these suffer there were correspond delight on the eighth dai the soul of the pilgrim resum their journei and in four dai came to a spot whenc thei look down upon a line of light in colour like a rainbow onli brighter and clearer on dai more brought them to the place and thei saw that thi wa the column of light which bind togeth the whole univers the end of the column were fasten to heaven and from them hung the distaff of necess on which all the heavenli bodi turnedth hook and spindl were of adam and the whorl of a mix substanc the whorl wa in form like a number of box fit into on anoth with their edg turn upward make togeth a singl whorl which wa pierc by the spindl the outermost had the rim broadest and the inner whorl were smaller and smaller and had their rim narrow the largest the fix star wa spangledth seventh the sun wa brightestth eighth the moon shone by the light of the seventhth second and fifth saturn and mercuri were most like on anoth and yellow than the eighthth third jupit had the whitest lightth fourth mar wa redth sixth venu wa in white second the whole had on motion but while thi wa revolv in on direct the seven inner circl were move in the opposit with variou degre of swift and slow the spindl turn on the knee of necess and a siren stood hymn upon each circl while lachesi clotho and atropo the daughter of necess sat on throne at equal interv sing of past present and futur respons to the music of the siren clotho from time to time guid the outer circl with a touch of her right hand atropo with her left hand touch and guid the inner circl lachesi in turn put forth her hand from time to time to guid both of them on their arriv the pilgrim went to lachesi and there wa an interpret who arrang them and take from her knee lot and sampl of live got up into a pulpit and said mortal soul hear the word of lachesi the daughter of necess a new period of mortal life ha begun and you mai choos what divin you pleas the respons of choos is with yougod is blameless after speak thu he cast the lot among them and each on took up the lot which fell near him he then place on the ground befor them the sampl of live mani more than the soul present and there were all sort of live of men and of anim there were tyranni end in miseri and exil and live of men and women famou for their differ qualiti and also mix live made up of wealth and poverti sick and health here glaucon is the great risk of human life and therefor the whole of educ should be direct to the acquisit of such a knowledg as will teach a man to refus the evil and choos the good he should know all the combin which occur in lifeof beauti with poverti or with wealthof knowledg with extern goodsand at last choos with refer to the natur of the soul regard that onli as the better life which make men better and leav the rest and a man must take with him an iron sens of truth and right into the world below that there too he mai remain undazzl by wealth or the allur of evil and be determin to avoid the extrem and choos the mean for thi as the messeng report the interpret to have said is the true happi of man and ani on as he proclaim mai if he choos with understand have a good lot even though he come last let not the first be careless in hi choic nor the last despair he spoke and when he had spoken he who had drawn the first lot chose a tyranni he did not see that he wa fate to devour hi own childrenand when he discov hi mistak he wept and beat hi breast blame chanc and the god and anybodi rather than himself he wa on of those who had come from heaven and in hi previou life had been a citizen of a wellord state but he had onli habit and no philosophi like mani anoth he made a bad choic becaus he had no experi of life wherea those who came from earth and had seen troubl were not in such a hurri to choos but if a man had follow philosophi while upon earth and had been moder fortun in hi lot he might not onli be happi here but hi pilgrimag both from and to thi world would be smooth and heavenli noth wa more curiou than the spectacl of the choic at onc sad and laughabl and wonder most of the soul onli seek to avoid their own condit in a previou life he saw the soul of orpheu chang into a swan becaus he would not be born of a woman there wa thamyra becom a nightingal music bird like the swan choos to be men the twentieth soul which wa that of ajax prefer the life of a lion to that of a man in remembr of the injustic which wa done to him in the judgment of the arm and agamemnon from a like enmiti to human natur pass into an eagl about the middl wa the soul of atalanta choos the honour of an athlet and next to her epeu take the natur of a workwoman among the last wa thersit who wa chang himself into a monkei thither the last of all came odysseu and sought the lot of a privat man which lai neglect and despis and when he found it he went awai rejoic and said that if he had been first instead of last hi choic would have been the same men too were seen pass into anim and wild and tame anim chang into on anoth when all the soul had chosen thei went to lachesi who sent with each of them their geniu or attend to fulfil their lot he first of all brought them under the hand of clotho and drew them within the revolut of the spindl impel by her hand from her thei were carri to atropo who made the thread irrevers whenc without turn round thei pass beneath the throne of necess and when thei had all pass thei move on in scorch heat to the plain of forget and rest at even by the river unmind whose water could not be retain in ani vessel of thi thei had all to drink a certain quantitysom of them drank more than wa requir and he who drank forgot all thing er himself wa prevent from drink when thei had gone to rest about the middl of the night there were thunderstorm and earthquak and suddenli thei were all driven diver wai shoot like star to their birth concern hi return to the bodi he onli knew that awak suddenli in the morn he found himself ly on the pyre thu glaucon the tale ha been save and will be our salvat if we believ that the soul is immort and hold fast to the heavenli wai of justic and knowledg so shall we pass undefil over the river of forget and be dear to ourselv and to the god and have a crown of reward and happi both in thi world and also in the millenni pilgrimag of the other the tenth book of the republ of plato fall into two divis first resum an old thread which ha been interrupt socrat assail the poet who now that the natur of the soul ha been analyz ar seen to be veri far gone from the truth and secondli have shown the realiti of the happi of the just he demand that appear shall be restor to him and then proce to prove the immort of the soul the argument as in the phaedo and gorgia is supplement by the vision of a futur life why plato who wa himself a poet and whose dialogu ar poem and drama should have been hostil to the poet as a class and especi to the dramat poet why he should not have seen that truth mai be embodi in vers as well as in prose and that there ar some indefin light and shadow of human life which can onli be express in poetrysom element of imagin which alwai entwin with reason why he should have suppos epic vers to be insepar associ with the impur of the old hellen mytholog why he should try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of utilityar question which have alwai been debat amongst student of plato though unabl to give a complet answer to them we mai showfirst that hi view aros natur out of the circumst of hi ag and secondli we mai elicit the truth as well as the error which is contain in them he is the enemi of the poet becaus poetri wa declin in hi own lifetim and a theatrocraci as he sai in the law had taken the place of an intellectu aristocraci euripid exhibit the last phase of the tragic drama and in him plato saw the friend and apologist of tyrant and the sophist of tragedi the old comedi wa almost extinct the new had not yet arisen dramat and lyric poetri like everi other branch of greek literatur wa fall under the power of rhetor there wa no second or third to aeschylu and sophocl in the gener which follow them aristophan in on of hi later comedi frog speak of thousand of tragedymak prattler whose attempt at poetri he compar to the chirp of swallow their garrul went far beyond euripidesthei appear onc upon the stage and there wa an end of them to a man of geniu who had a real appreci of the godlik aeschylu and the nobl and gentl sophocl though disagre with some part of their theologi rep these minor poet must have been contempt and intoler there is no feel stronger in the dialogu of plato than a sens of the declin and decai both in literatur and in polit which mark hi own ag nor can he have been expect to look with favour on the licenc of aristophan now at the end of hi career who had begun by satir socrat in the cloud and in a similar spirit forti year afterward had satir the founder of ideal commonwealth in hi eccleziazusa or femal parliament law there were other reason for the antagon of plato to poetri the profess of an actor wa regard by him as a degrad of human natur for on man in hi life cannot plai mani part the charact which the actor perform seem to destroi hi own charact and to leav noth which can be truli call himself neither can ani man live hi life and act it the actor is the slave of hi art not the master of it take thi view plato is more decid in hi expuls of the dramat than of the epic poet though he must have known that the greek tragedian afford nobl lesson and exampl of virtu and patriot to which noth in homer can be compar but great dramat or even great rhetor power is hardli consist with firm or strength of mind and dramat talent is often incident associ with a weak or dissolut charact in the tenth book plato introduc a new seri of object first he sai that the poet or painter is an imit and in the third degre remov from the truth hi creation ar not test by rule and measur thei ar onli appear in modern time we should sai that art is not mere imit but rather the express of the ideal in form of sens even adopt the humbl imag of plato from which hi argument deriv a colour we should maintain that the artist mai ennobl the bed which he paint by the fold of the draperi or by the feel of home which he introduc and there have been modern painter who have impart such an ideal interest to a blacksmith or a carpent shop the ey or mind which feel as well as see can give digniti and patho to a ruin mill or a strawbuilt shed rembrandt to the hull of a vessel go to it last home turner still more would thi appli to the greatest work of art which seem to be the visibl embodi of the divin had plato been ask whether the zeu or athen of pheidia wa the imit of an imit onli would he not have been compel to admit that someth more wa to be found in them than in the form of ani mortal and that the rule of proport to which thei conform wa higher far than ani geometri or arithmet could express statesman again plato object to the imit art that thei express the emot rather than the ration part of human natur he doe not admit aristotl theori that tragedi or other seriou imit ar a purgat of the passion by piti and fear to him thei appear onli to afford the opportun of indulg them yet we must acknowledg that we mai sometim cure disord emot by give express to them and that thei often gain strength when pent up within our own breast it is not everi indulg of the feel which is to be condemn for there mai be a gratif of the higher as well as of the lowerthought which ar too deep or too sad to be express by ourselv mai find an utter in the word of poet everi on would acknowledg that there have been time when thei were consol and elev by beauti music or by the sublim of architectur or by the peac of natur plato ha himself admit in the earlier part of the republ that the art might have the effect of harmon as well as of enerv the mind but in the tenth book he regard them through a stoic or puritan medium he ask onli what good have thei done and is not satisfi with the repli that thei have given innoc pleasur to mankind he tell us that he rejoic in the banish of the poet sinc he ha found by the analysi of the soul that thei ar concern with the inferior faculti he mean to sai that the higher faculti have to do with univers the lower with particular of sens the poet ar on a level with their own ag but not on a level with socrat and plato and he wa well awar that homer and hesiod could not be made a rule of life by ani process of legitim interpret hi iron us of them is in fact a denial of their author he saw too that the poet were not criticsa he sai in the apolog ani on wa a better interpret of their write than thei were themselv he himself ceas to be a poet when he becam a discipl of socrat though as he tell us of solon he might have been on of the greatest of them if he had not been deter by other pursuit tim thu from mani point of view there is an antagon between plato and the poet which wa foreshadow to him in the old quarrel between philosophi and poetri the poet as he sai in the protagora were the sophist of their dai and hi dislik of the on class is reflect on the other he regard them both as the enemi of reason and abstract though in the case of euripid more with refer to hi immor sentiment about tyrant and the like for plato is the prophet who came into the world to convinc menfirst of the fallibl of sens and opinion and secondli of the realiti of abstract idea whatev strang there mai be in modern time in oppos philosophi to poetri which to us seem to have so mani element in common the strang will disappear if we conceiv of poetri as alli to sens and of philosophi as equival to thought and abstract unfortun the veri word idea which to plato is express of the most real of all thing is associ in our mind with an element of subject and unreal we mai note also how he differ from aristotl who declar poetri to be truer than histori for the opposit reason becaus it is concern with univers not like histori with particular poet the thing which ar seen ar oppos in scriptur to the thing which ar unseenthei ar equal oppos in plato to univers and idea to him all particular appear to be float about in a world of sens thei have a taint of error or even of evil there is no difficulti in see that thi is an illus for there is no more error or variat in an individu man hors bed etc than in the class man hors bed etc nor is the truth which is displai in individu instanc less certain than that which is convei through the medium of idea but plato who is deepli impress with the real import of univers as instrument of thought attribut to them an essenti truth which is imaginari and unreal for univers mai be often fals and particular true had he attain to ani clear concept of the individu which is the synthesi of the univers and the particular or had he been abl to distinguish between opinion and sensat which the ambigu of the word greek and the like tend to confus he would not have deni truth to the particular of sens but the poet ar also the repres of falsehood and feign in all depart of life and knowledg like the sophist and rhetorician of the gorgia and phaedru thei ar the fals priest fals prophet ly spirit enchant of the world there is anoth count put into the indict against them by plato that thei ar the friend of the tyrant and bask in the sunshin of hi patronag despot in all ag ha had an apparatu of fals idea and fals teacher at it servicein the histori of modern europ as well as of greec and rome for no govern of men depend sole upon forc without some corrupt of literatur and moralssom appeal to the imagin of the massessom pretenc to the favour of heavensom element of good give power to evil tyranni even for a short time cannot be maintain the greek tyrant were not insens to the import of awaken in their caus a pseudohellen feel thei were proud of success at the olymp game thei were not devoid of the love of literatur and art plato is think in the first instanc of greek poet who had grace the court of dionysiu or archelau and the old spirit of freedom is rous within him at their prostitut of the tragic muse in the prais of tyranni but hi prophet ey extend beyond them to the fals teacher of other ag who ar the creatur of the govern under which thei live he compar the corrupt of hi contemporari with the idea of a perfect societi and gather up into on mass of evil the evil and error of mankind to him thei ar personifi in the rhetorician sophist poet ruler who deceiv and govern the world a further object which plato make to poetri and the imit art is that thei excit the emot here the modern reader will be dispos to introduc a distinct which appear to have escap him for the emot ar neither bad nor good in themselv and ar not most like to be control by the attempt to erad them but by the moder indulg of them and the vocat of art is to present thought in the form of feel to enlist the feel on the side of reason to inspir even for a moment

human mind poetri and other form of fiction mai certainli be regard as a good but we can also imagin the exist of an ag in which a sever concept of truth ha either banish or transform them at ani rate we must admit that thei hold a differ place at differ period of the world histori in the infanc of mankind poetri with the except of proverb is the whole of literatur and the onli instrument of intellectu cultur in modern time she is the shadow or echo of her former self and appear to have a precari exist milton in hi dai doubt whether an epic poem wa ani longer possibl at the same time we must rememb that what plato would have call the charm of poetri have been partli transfer to prose he himself statesman admit rhetor to be the handmaiden of polit and propos to find in the strain of law law a substitut for the old poet among ourselv the creativ power seem often to be grow weaker and scientif fact to be more engross and overpow to the mind than formerli the illus of the feel commonli call love ha hitherto been the inspir influenc of modern poetri and romanc and ha exercis a human if not a strengthen influenc on the world but mai not the stimulu which love ha given to fanci be some dai exhaust the modern english novel which is the most popular of all form of read is not more than a centuri or two old will the tale of love a hundr year henc after so mani thousand variat of the same theme be still receiv with unab interest art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophi or religion and mai often corrupt them it is possibl to conceiv a mental state in which all artist represent ar regard as a fals and imperfect express either of the religi ideal or of the philosoph ideal the fairest form mai be revolt in certain mood of mind as is prove by the fact that the mahometan and mani sect of christian have renounc the us of pictur and imag the begin of a great religion whether christian or gentil ha not been wood or stone but a spirit move in the heart of men the discipl have met in a larg upper room or in hole and cave of the earth in the second or third gener thei have had mosqu templ church monasteri and the reviv or reform of religion like the first revel of them ha come from within and ha gener disregard extern ceremoni and accompani but poetri and art mai also be the express of the highest truth and the purest sentiment plato himself seem to waver between two opposit viewswhen as in the third book he insist that youth should be brought up amid wholesom imageri and again in book x when he banish the poet from hi republ admit that the art which some of us almost deifi have fallen short of their higher aim we must admit on the other hand that to banish imagin wholli would be suicid as well as imposs for natur too is a form of art and a breath of the fresh air or a singl glanc at the vari landscap would in an instant reviv and reillumin the extinguish spark of poetri in the human breast in the lower stage of civil imagin more than reason distinguish man from the anim and to banish art would be to banish thought to banish languag to banish the express of all truth no religion is wholli devoid of extern form even the mahometan who renounc the us of pictur and imag ha a templ in which he worship the most high as solemn and beauti as ani greek or christian build feel too and thought ar not realli oppos for he who think must feel befor he can execut and the highest thought when thei becom familiar to us ar alwai tend to pass into the form of feel plato doe not serious intend to expel poet from life and societi but he feel strongli the unreal of their write he is protest against the degeneraci of poetri in hi own dai as we might protest against the want of seriou purpos in modern fiction against the unseemli or extravag of some of our poet or novelist against the timeserv of preacher or public writer against the regardless of truth which to the ey of the philosoph seem to character the greater part of the world for we too have reason to complain that our poet and novelist paint inferior truth and ar concern with the inferior part of the soul that the reader of them becom what thei read and ar injuri affect by them and we look in vain for that healthi atmospher of which plato speaksth beauti which meet the sens like a breez and impercept draw the soul even in childhood into harmoni with the beauti of reason for there might be a poetri which would be the hymn of divin perfect the harmoni of good and truth among men a strain which should renew the youth of the world and bring back the ag in which the poet wa man onli teacher and best friendwhich would find materi in the live present as well as in the romanc of the past and might subdu to the fairest form of speech and vers the intract materi of modern civilisationwhich might elicit the simpl principl or as plato would have call them the essenti form of truth and justic out of the varieti of opinion and the complex of modern societywhich would preserv all the good of each gener and leav the bad unsungwhich should be base not on vain long or faint imagin but on a clear insight into the natur of man then the tale of love might begin again in poetri or prose two in on unit in the pursuit of knowledg or the servic of god and man and feel of love might still be the incent to great thought and heroic deed as in the dai of dant or petrarch and mani type of manli and womanli beauti might appear among us rise abov the ordinari level of human and mani live which were like poem law be not onli written but live by us a few such strain have been heard among men in the tragedi of aeschylu and sophocl whom plato quot not as homer is quot by him in ironi but with deep and seriou approvalin the poetri of milton and wordsworth and in passag of other english poetsfirst and abov all in the hebrew prophet and psalmist shakespear ha taught us how great men should speak and act he ha drawn charact of a wonder puriti and depth he ha ennobl the human mind but like homer rep he ha left no wai of life the next greatest poet of modern time goeth is concern with a lower degre of truth he paint the world as a stage on which all the men and women ar mere player he cultiv life as an art but he furnish no ideal of truth and action the poet mai rebel against ani attempt to set limit to hi fanci and he mai argu truli that moral in vers is not poetri possibl like mephistophel in faust he mai retali on hi adversari but the philosoph will still be justifi in ask how mai the heavenli gift of poesi be devot to the good of mankind return to plato we mai observ that a similar mixtur of truth and error appear in other part of the argument he is awar of the absurd of mankind frame their whole live accord to homer just as in the phaedru he intim the absurd of interpret mytholog upon ration principl both these were the modern tendenc of hi own ag which he deservedli ridicul on the other hand hi argument that homer if he had been abl to teach mankind anyth worth know would not have been allow by them to go about beg as a rhapsodist is both fals and contrari to the spirit of plato rep it mai be compar with those other paradox of the gorgia that no statesman wa ever unjustli put to death by the citi of which he wa the head and that no sophist wa ever defraud by hi pupil gorg the argument for immort seem to rest on the absolut dualism of soul and bodi admit the exist of the soul we know of no forc which is abl to put an end to her vice is her own proper evil and if she cannot be destroi by that she cannot be destroi by ani other yet plato ha acknowledg that the soul mai be so overgrown by the incrust of earth as to lose her origin form and in the timaeu he recogn more strongli than in the republ the influenc which the bodi ha over the mind deni even the voluntari of human action on the ground that thei proce from physic state tim in the republ as elsewher he waver between the origin soul which ha to be restor and the charact which is develop by train and educ the vision of anoth world is ascrib to er the son of armeniu who is said by clement of alexandria to have been zoroast the tale ha certainli an orient charact and mai be compar with the pilgrimag of the soul in the zend avesta haug avesta but no trace of acquaint with zoroast is found elsewher in plato write and there is no reason for give him the name of er the pamphylian the philosophi of heracleitu cannot be shown to be borrow from zoroast and still less the myth of plato the local arrang of the vision is less distinct than that of the phaedru and phaedo astronomi is mingl with symbol and mytholog the great sphere of heaven is repres under the symbol of a cylind or box contain the seven orbit of the planet and the fix star thi is suspend from an axi or spindl which turn on the knee of necess the revolut of the seven orbit contain in the cylind ar guid by the fate and their harmoni motion produc the music of the sphere through the innermost or eighth of these which is the moon is pass the spindl but it is doubt whether thi is the continu of the column of light from which the pilgrim contempl the heaven the word of plato impli that thei ar connect but not the same the column itself is clearli not of adam the spindl which is of adam is fasten to the end of the chain which extend to the middl of the column of lightthi column is said to hold togeth the heaven but whether it hang from the spindl or is at right angl to it is not explain the cylind contain the orbit of the star is almost as much a symbol as the figur of necess turn the spindlefor the outermost rim is the sphere of the fix star and noth is said about the interv of space which divid the path of the star in the heaven the descript is both a pictur and an orreri and therefor is necessarili inconsist with itself the column of light is not the milki waywhich is neither straight nor like a rainbowbut the imaginari axi of the earth thi is compar to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour and not to the undergird of a trirem but to the straight rope run from prow to stern in which the undergird meet the orreri or pictur of the heaven given in the republ differ in it mode of represent from the circl of the same and of the other in the timaeu in both the fix star ar distinguish from the planet and thei move in orbit without them although in an opposit direct in the republ as in the timaeu thei ar all move round the axi of the world but we ar not certain that in the former thei ar move round the earth no distinct mention is made in the republ of the circl of the same and other although both in the timaeu and in the republ the motion of the fix star is suppos to coincid with the motion of the whole the rel thick of the rim is perhap design to express the rel distanc of the planet plato probabl intend to repres the earth from which er and hi companion ar view the heaven as stationari in place but whether or not herself revolv unless thi is impli in the revolut of the axi is uncertain timaeu the spectat mai be suppos to look at the heavenli bodi either from abov or below the earth is a sort of earth and heaven in on like the heaven of the phaedru on the back of which the spectat goe out to take a peep at the star and is born round in the revolut there is no distinct between the equat and the eclipt but plato is no doubt led to imagin that the planet have an opposit motion to that of the fix star in order to account for their appear in the heaven in the descript of the meadow and the retribut of the good and evil after death there ar trace of homer the descript of the axi as a spindl and of the heavenli bodi as form a whole partli aris out of the attempt to connect the motion of the heavenli bodi with the mytholog imag of the web or weav of the fate the give of the lot the weav of them and the make of them irrevers which ar ascrib to the three fateslachesi clotho atropo ar obvious deriv from their name the element of chanc in human life is indic by the order of the lot but chanc howev advers mai be overcom by the wisdom of man if he know how to choos aright there is a wors enemi to man than chanc thi enemi is himself he who wa moder fortun in the number of the loteven the veri last comermight have a good life if he chose with wisdom and as plato doe not like to make an assert which is unproven he more than confirm thi statement a few sentenc afterward by the exampl of odysseu who chose last but the virtu which is found on habit is not suffici to enabl a man to choos he must add to virtu knowledg if he is to act rightli when place in new circumst the routin of good action and good habit is an inferior sort of good and as coleridg sai common sens is intoler which is not base on metaphys so plato would have said habit is worthless which is not base upon philosophi the freedom of the will to refus the evil and to choos the good is distinctli assert virtu is free and as a man honour or dishonour her he will have more or less of her the life of man is round by necess there ar circumst prior to birth which affect him pol but within the wall of necess there is an

charact of the republ which present two faceson an hellen state the other a kingdom of philosoph connect with the latter of the two aspect ar the paradox of the republ as thei have been term by morgenstern a the commun of properti b of famili c the rule of philosoph d the analog of the individu and the state which like some other analog in the republ is carri too far we mai then proce to consid the subject of educ as conceiv by plato bring togeth in a gener view the educ of youth and the educ of afterlif we mai note further some essenti differ between ancient and modern polit which ar suggest by the republ we mai compar the politicu and the law we mai observ the influenc exercis by plato on hi imit and take occas to consid the natur and valu of polit and of religi ideal plato expressli sai that he is intend to found an hellen state book v mani of hi regul ar characterist spartan such as the prohibit of gold and silver the common meal of the men the militari train of the youth the gymnast exercis of the women the life of sparta wa the life of a camp law enforc even more rigidli in time of peac than in war the citizen of sparta like plato were forbidden to tradethei were to be soldier and not shopkeep nowher els in greec wa the individu so complet subject to the state the time when he wa to marri the educ of hi children the cloth which he wa to wear the food which he wa to eat were all prescrib by law some of the best enact in the republ such as the rever to be paid to parent and elder and some of the worst such as the exposur of deform children ar borrow from the practic of sparta the encourag of friendship between men and youth or of men with on anoth as afford incent to braveri is also spartan in sparta too a nearer approach wa made than in ani other greek state to equal of the sex and to commun of properti and while there wa probabl less of licenti in the sens of immor the tie of marriag wa regard more lightli than in the rest of greec the suprema lex wa the preserv of the famili and the interest of the state the coars strength of a militari govern wa not favour to puriti and refin and the excess strict of some regul seem to have produc a reaction of all hellen the spartan were most access to briberi sever of the greatest of them might be describ in the word of plato as have a fierc secret long after gold and silver though not in the strict sens communist the principl of commun wa maintain among them in their divis of land in their common meal in their slave and in the free us of on anoth good marriag wa a public institut and the women were educ by the state and sang and danc in public with the men mani tradit were preserv at sparta of the sever with which the magistr had maintain the primit rule of music and poetri as in the republ of plato the newfangl poet wa to be expel hymn to the god which ar the onli kind of music admit into the ideal state were the onli kind which wa permit at sparta the spartan though an unpoet race were nevertheless lover of poetri thei had been stir by the elegiac strain of tyrtaeu thei had crowd around hippia to hear hi recit of homer but in thi thei resembl the citizen of the timocrat rather than of the ideal state the council of elder men also correspond to the spartan gerousia and the freedom with which thei ar permit to judg about matter of detail agre with what we ar told of that institut onc more the militari rule of not spoil the dead or offer arm at the templ the moder in the pursuit of enemi the import attach to the physic wellb of the citizen the us of warfar for the sake of defenc rather than of aggressionar featur probabl suggest by the spirit and practic of sparta to the spartan type the ideal state revert in the first declin and the charact of the individu timocrat is borrow from the spartan citizen the love of lacedaemon not onli affect plato and xenophon but wa share by mani undistinguish athenian there thei seem to find a principl which wa want in their own democraci the greek of the spartan attract them that is to sai not the good of their law but the spirit of order and loyalti which prevail fascin by the idea citizen of athen would imit the lacedaemonian in their dress and manner thei were known to the contemporari of plato as the person who had their ear bruis like the roundhead of the commonwealth the love of anoth church or countri when seen at a distanc onli the long for an imaginari simplic in civil time the fond desir of a past which never ha been or of a futur which never will bethes ar aspir of the human mind which ar often felt among ourselv such feel meet with a respons in the republ of plato but there ar other featur of the platon republ as for exampl the literari and philosoph educ and the grace and beauti of life which ar the revers of spartan plato wish to give hi citizen a tast of athenian freedom as well as of lacedaemonian disciplin hi individu geniu is pure athenian although in theori he is a lover of sparta and he is someth more than eitherh ha also a true hellen feel he is desir of human the war of hellen against on anoth he acknowledg that the delphian god is the grand hereditari interpret of all hella the spirit of harmoni and the dorian mode ar to prevail and the whole state is to have an extern beauti which is the reflex of the harmoni within but he ha not yet found out the truth which he afterward enunci in the lawsthat he wa a better legisl who made men to be of on mind than he who train them for war the citizen as in other hellen state democrat as well as aristocrat ar realli an upper class for although no mention is made of slave the lower class ar allow to fade awai into the distanc and ar repres in the individu by the passion plato ha no idea either of a social state in which all class ar harmon or of a feder of hella or the world in which differ nation or state have a place hi citi is equip for war rather than for peac and thi would seem to be justifi by the ordinari condit of hellen state the myth of the earthborn men is an embodi of the orthodox tradit of hella and the allus to the four ag of the world is also sanction by the author of hesiod and the poet thu we see that the republ is partli found on the ideal of the old greek poli partli on the actual circumst of hella in that ag plato like the old painter retain the tradit form and like them he ha also a vision of a citi in the cloud there is yet anoth thread which is interwoven in the textur of the work for the republ is not onli a dorian state but a pythagorean leagu the wai of life which wa connect with the name of pythagora like the cathol monast order show the power which the mind of an individu might exercis over hi contemporari and mai have natur suggest to plato the possibl of reviv such mediaev institut the pythagorean like plato enforc a rule of life and a moral and intellectu train the influenc ascrib to music which to us seem exagger is also a pythagorean featur it is not to be regard as repres the real influenc of music in the greek world more nearli than ani other govern of hella the pythagorean leagu of three hundr wa an aristocraci of virtu for onc in the histori of mankind the philosophi of order or greek express and consequ enlist on it side the combin endeavour of the better part of the peopl obtain the manag of public affair and held possess of it for a consider time until about bc probabl onli in state prepar by dorian institut would such a leagu have been possibl the ruler like plato greek were requir to submit to a sever train in order to prepar the wai for the educ of the other member of the commun long after the dissolut of the order emin pythagorean such as archyta of tarentum retain their polit influenc over the citi of magna graecia there wa much here that wa suggest to the kindr spirit of plato who had doubtless medit deepli on the wai of life of pythagora rep and hi follow slight trace of pythagorean ar to be found in the mystic number of the state in the number which express the interv between the king and the tyrant in the doctrin of transmigr in the music of the sphere as well as in the great though secondari import ascrib to mathemat in educ but as in hi philosophi so also in the form of hi state he goe far beyond the old pythagorean he attempt a task realli imposs which is to unit the past of greek histori with the futur of philosophi analog to that other imposs which ha often been the dream of christendom the attempt to unit the past histori of europ with the kingdom of christ noth actual exist in the world at all resembl plato ideal state nor doe he himself imagin that such a state is possibl thi he repeat again and again eg in the republ or in the law where cast a glanc back on the republ he admit that the perfect state of commun and philosophi wa imposs in hi own ag though still to be retain as a pattern the same doubt is impli in the earnest with which he argu in the republ that ideal ar none the wors becaus thei cannot be realiz in fact and in the choru of laughter which like a break wave will as he anticip greet the mention of hi propos though like other writer of fiction he us all hi art to give realiti to hi invent when ask how the ideal politi can come into be he answer iron when on son of a king becom a philosoph he design the fiction of the earthborn men as a nobl lie and when the structur is final complet he fairli tell you that hi republ is a vision onli which in some sens mai have realiti but not in the vulgar on of a reign of philosoph upon earth it ha been said that plato fli as well as walk but thi fall short of the truth for he fli and walk at the same time and is in the air and on firm ground in success instant niebuhr ha ask a trifl question which mai be briefli notic in thi placewa plato a good citizen if by thi is meant wa he loyal to athenian institutionsh can hardli be said to be the friend of democraci but neither is he the friend of ani other exist form of govern all of them he regard as state of faction law none attain to hi ideal of a voluntari rule over voluntari subject which seem inde more nearli to describ democraci than ani other and the worst of them is tyranni the truth is that the question ha hardli ani mean when appli to a great philosoph whose write ar not meant for a particular ag and countri but for all time and all mankind the declin of athenian polit wa probabl the motiv which led plato to frame an ideal state and the republ mai be regard as reflect the depart glori of hella as well might we complain of st augustin whose great work the citi of god origin in a similar motiv for not be loyal to the roman empir even a nearer parallel might be afford by the first christian who cannot fairli be charg with be bad citizen becaus though subject to the higher power thei were look forward to a citi which is in heaven the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judg of accord to the ordinari notion of mankind the paradox of on ag have been said to becom the commonplac of the next but the paradox of plato ar at least as paradox to us as thei were to hi contemporari the modern world ha either sneer at them as absurd or denounc them as unnatur and immor men have been pleas to find in aristotl critic of them the anticip of their own good sens the wealthi and cultiv class have dislik and also dread them thei have point with satisfact to the failur of effort to realiz them in practic yet sinc thei ar the thought of on of the greatest of human intellig and of on who had done most to elev moral and religion thei seem to deserv a better treatment at our hand we mai have to address the public as plato doe poetri and assur them that we mean no harm to exist institut there ar seriou error which have a side of truth and which therefor mai fairli demand a care consider there ar truth mix with error of which we mai inde sai the half is better than the whole yet the half mai be an import contribut to the studi of human natur a the first paradox is the commun of good which is mention slightli at the end of the third book and seemingli as aristotl observ is confin to the guardian at least no mention is made of the other class but the omiss is not of ani real signific and probabl aris out of the plan of the work which prevent the writer from enter into detail aristotl censur the commun of properti much in the spirit of modern polit economi as tend to repress industri and as do awai with the spirit of benevol modern writer almost refus to consid the subject which is suppos to have been long ago settl by the common opinion of mankind but it must be rememb that the sacred of properti is a notion far more fix in modern than in ancient time the world ha grown older and is therefor more conserv primit societi offer mani exampl of land held in common either by a tribe or by a township and such mai probabl have been the origin form of land tenur ancient legisl had invent variou mode of divid and preserv the divis of land among the citizen accord to aristotl there were nation who held the land in common and divid the produc and there were other who divid the land and store the produc in common the evil of debt and the inequ of properti were far greater in ancient than in modern time and the accid to which properti wa subject from war or revolut or taxat or other legisl interfer were also greater all these circumst gave properti a less fix and sacr charact the earli christian ar believ to have held their properti in common and the principl is sanction by the word of christ himself and ha been maintain as a counsel of perfect in almost all ag of the church nor have there been want instanc of modern enthusiast who have made a religion of commun in everi ag of religi excit notion like wycliff inherit of grace have tend to prevail a like spirit but fiercer and more violent ha appear in polit the prepar of the gospel of peac soon becom the red flag of republican we can hardli judg what effect plato view would have upon hi own contemporari thei would perhap have seem to them onli an exagger of the spartan commonwealth even modern writer would acknowledg that the right of privat properti is base on expedi and mai be interf with in a varieti of wai for the public good ani other mode of vest properti which wa found to be more advantag would in time acquir the same basi of right the most us in plato word would be the most sacr the lawyer and ecclesiast of former ag would have spoken of properti as a sacr institut but thei onli meant by such languag to oppos the greatest amount of resist to ani invas of the right of individu and of the church when we consid the question without ani fear of immedi applic to practic in the spirit of plato republ ar we quit sure that the receiv notion of properti ar the best is the distribut of wealth which is customari in civil countri the most favour that can be conceiv for the educ and develop of the mass of mankind can the spectat of all time and all exist be quit convinc that on or two thousand year henc great chang will not have taken place in the right of properti or even that the veri notion of properti beyond what is necessari for person mainten mai not have disappear thi wa a distinct familiar to aristotl though like to be laugh at among ourselv such a chang would not be greater than some other chang through which the world ha pass in the transit from ancient to modern societi for exampl the emancip of the serf in russia or the abolit of slaveri in america and the west indi and not so great as the differ which separ the eastern villag commun from the western world to accomplish such a revolut in the cours of a few centuri would impli a rate of progress not more rapid than ha actual taken place dure the last fifti or sixti year the kingdom of japan underw more chang in five or six year than europ in five or six hundr mani opinion and belief which have been cherish among ourselv quit as strongli as the sacred of properti have pass awai and the most unten proposit respect the right of bequest or entail have been maintain with as much fervour as the most moder some on will be heard to ask whether a state of societi can be final in which the interest of thousand ar peril on the life or charact of a singl person and mani will indulg the hope that our present condit mai after all be onli transit and mai conduct to a higher in which properti besid minist to the enjoy of the few mai also furnish the mean of the highest cultur to all and will be a greater benefit to the public gener and also more under the control of public author there mai come a time when the sai have i not a right to do what i will with my own will appear to be a barbar relic of individualismwhen the possess of a part mai be a greater bless to each and all than the possess of the whole is now to ani on such reflect appear visionari to the ey of the practic statesman but thei ar within the rang of possibl to the philosoph he can imagin that in some distant ag or clime and through the influenc of some individu the notion of common properti mai or might have sunk as deep into the heart of a race and have becom as fix to them as privat properti is to ourselv he know that thi latter institut is not more than four or five thousand year old mai not the end revert to the begin in our own ag even utopia affect the spirit of legisl and an abstract idea mai exercis a great influenc on practic polit the object that would be gener urg against plato commun of properti ar the old on of aristotl that motiv for exert would be taken awai and that disput would aris when each wa depend upon all everi man would produc as littl and consum as much as he like the experi of civil nation ha hitherto been advers to social the effort is too great for human natur men try to live in common but the person feel is alwai break in on the other hand it mai be doubt whether our present notion of properti ar not convent for thei differ in differ countri and in differ state of societi we boast of an individu which is not freedom but rather an artifici result of the industri state of modern europ the individu is nomin free but he is also powerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chain of econom necess even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to becom disinterest at ani rate we observ in them a power of organ which fifti year ago would never have been suspect the same forc which have revolution the polit system of europ mai effect a similar chang in the social and industri relat of mankind and if we suppos the influenc of some good as well as neutral motiv work in the commun there will be no absurd in expect that the mass of mankind have power and becom enlighten about the higher possibl of human life when thei learn how much more is attain for all than is at present the possess of a favour few mai pursu the common interest with an intellig and persist which mankind have hitherto never seen now that the world ha onc been set in motion and is no longer held fast under the tyranni of custom and ignor now that critic ha pierc the veil of tradit and the past no longer overpow the presentth progress of civil mai be expect to be far greater and swifter than heretofor even at our present rate of speed the point at which we mai arriv in two or three gener is beyond the power of imagin to forese there ar forc in the world which work not in an arithmet but in a geometr ratio of increas educ to us the express of plato move like a wheel with an evermultipli rapid nor

that women ar half the human race in some respect the more import half law and for the sake both of men and women he desir to rais the woman to a higher level of exist he bring not sentiment but philosophi to bear upon a question which both in ancient and modern time ha been chiefli regard in the light of custom or feel the greek had nobl concept of womanhood in the goddess athen and artemi and in the heroin antigon and andromach but these ideal had no counterpart in actual life the athenian woman wa in no wai the equal of her husband she wa not the entertain of hi guest or the mistress

the greatest glori who ha the least renown among men is the historian concept of feminin excel a veri differ ideal of womanhood is held up by plato to the world she is to be the companion of the man

characterist of the femal sex the modern antagonist of the equal of the sex would argu that the differ between men and women ar not confin to the singl point urg by plato that sensibl gentl grace ar the qualiti of women while energi strength higher intellig ar to be look for in men and the critic is just the differ affect the whole natur and ar not as plato suppos confin to a singl point but neither can we sai how far these differ ar due to educ and the opinion of mankind or physic inherit from the habit and opinion of former gener women have been alwai taught not exactli that thei ar

few of us can safe enquir into the thing which natur hide ani more than we can dissect our own bodi still the manner in which plato arriv at hi conclus should be consid for here as mr grote ha remark is a wonder thing that on of the wisest and best of men should have entertain idea of moral which ar wholli at varianc with our own and if we would do plato justic we must examin carefulli the charact of hi propos first we mai observ that the relat of the sex suppos by him ar the revers of licenti he seem rather to aim at an imposs strict secondli he conceiv the famili to be the natur enemi of the

though as yet imperfectli that the individu man ha an endless valu in the sight of god and that we honour him when we honour the darken and disfigur imag of him law thi is the lesson which christ taught in a parabl when he said their angel do alwai behold the face of my father which is in heaven such lesson ar onli partial realiz in ani ag thei were foreign to the ag of plato as thei have veri

while from the modern and christian point of view we regard him as sanction murder and destroi the first principl of moral the great error in these and similar specul is that the differ between man and the anim is forgotten in them the human be is regard with the ey of a dog or birdfanci or at best of a slaveown the higher or human qualiti ar left out the breeder of anim aim chiefli at size or speed or strength in a few case at courag or temper most often the fit of the anim for food is the great desideratum but mankind ar not bred to be eaten nor yet for their superior in fight or in run or in draw cart neither doe the improv of the human race consist mere in the increas of the bone and flesh but in the growth and enlighten of the mind henc there must be a marriag of true mind as well as of bodi of imagin and reason as well as of lust and instinct men and women without feel or imagin ar justli call brute yet plato take awai these qualiti and put noth in their place not even the

if he had not lost sight of hi own illustr for the nobler sort of bird and beast nourish and protect their offspr and ar faith to on anoth an emin physiologist think it worth while to try and place life on a physic basi but should not life rest on the moral rather than upon the physic the higher come first then the lower first the human and ration afterward the anim yet thei ar not absolut divid and in time of sick or moment of selfindulg thei seem to be onli differ aspect of a common human natur which includ them both neither is the moral the limit of the physic but the expans and enlarg of itth highest form which the physic is capabl of receiv as plato would sai the bodi doe not take care of the bodi and still less of the mind but the mind take care of both in all human action not that which is common to man and the anim is the characterist element but that which distinguish him from them even if we admit the physic basi and resolv all virtu into health of bodi la facon que notr sang circul still on mere physic ground we must come back to idea mind and reason and duti and conscienc under these or other name ar alwai reappear there cannot be health of bodi without health of mind nor health of mind without the sens of duti and the love of truth charm that the greatest of ancient philosoph should in hi regul about marriag have fallen into the error of separ bodi and mind doe inde appear surpris yet the wonder is not so much that plato should have entertain idea of moral which to our own ag ar revolt but that he should have contradict himself to an extent which is hardli credibl fall in an instant from the heaven of ideal into the crudest anim rejoic in the newli found gift of reflect he appear to have thought out a subject about which he had better have follow the enlighten feel of hi own ag the gener sentiment of hella wa oppos to hi monstrou fanci the old poet and in later time the tragedian show no want of respect for the famili on which much of their religion wa base but the exampl of sparta and perhap in some degre the tendenc to defi public opinion seem to have misl him he will make on famili out of all the famili of the state he will select the finest specimen of men and women and breed from these onli yet becaus the illus is alwai return for the anim part of human natur will from time to time assert itself in the disguis of philosophi as well as of poetri and also becaus ani departur from establish moral even where thi is not intend is apt to be unsettl it mai be worth while to draw out a littl more at length the object to the platon marriag in the first place histori show that wherev polygami ha been larg allow the race ha deterior on man to on woman is the law of god and natur nearli all the civil peopl of the world at some

call hi own the partial exist of such custom among some of the lower race of man and the surviv of peculiar ceremoni in the marriag of some civil nation ar thought to furnish a proof of similar institut have been onc univers there can be no question that the studi of anthropolog ha consider chang our view respect the first appear of man upon the earth we know more about the aborigin of the world than formerli but our increas knowledg show abov all thing how littl we know with all the help which written monument afford we do but faintli realiz the condit of man two thousand or three thousand year ago of what hi condit wa when remov to a distanc or year when the major of mankind were lower and nearer the anim than ani tribe now exist upon the earth we cannot even entertain conjectur plato law and aristotl metaph mai have been more right than we imagin in suppos that some form of civilis were discov and lost sever time over if we cannot argu that all barbar is a degrad civil neither can we set ani limit to the depth of degrad to which the human race mai sink through war diseas or isol and if we ar to draw infer about the origin of marriag from the practic of barbar nation we should also consid the remot analog of the anim mani bird and anim especi the carnivor have onli on mate and the love and care of offspr which seem to be natur is inconsist with the primit theori of marriag if we go back to an imaginari state in which men were almost anim and the companion of them we have as much right to argu from what is anim to what is human as from the barbar to the civil man the record of anim life on the globe is fragmentaryth connect link ar want and cannot be suppli the record of social life is still more fragmentari and precari even if we admit that our first ancestor had no such institut as marriag still the stage by which men pass from outer barbar to the compar civil of china assyria and greec or even of the ancient german ar wholli unknown to us such specul ar apt to be unsettl becaus thei seem to show that an institut which wa thought to be a revel from heaven is onli the growth of histori and experi we ask what is the origin of marriag and we ar told that like the right of properti after mani war and contest it ha gradual arisen out of the selfish of barbarian we stand face to face with human natur in it primit naked we ar compel to accept not the highest but the lowest account of the origin of human societi but on the other hand we mai truli sai that everi step in human progress ha been in the same direct and that in the cours of ag the idea of marriag and of the famili ha been more and more defin and consecr the civil east is immeasur in advanc of ani savag tribe the greek and roman have improv upon the east the christian nation have been stricter in their view of the marriag relat than ani of the ancient in thi as in so mani other thing instead of look back with regret to the past we should look forward with hope to the futur we must consecr that which we believ to be the most holi and that which is the most holi will be the most us there is more reason for maintain the sacred of the marriag tie when we see the benefit of it than when we onli felt a vagu religi horror about the violat of it but in all time of transit when establish belief ar be undermin there is a danger that in the passag from the old to the new we mai insens let go the moral principl find an excus for listen to the voic of passion in the uncertainti of knowledg or the fluctuat of opinion and there ar mani person in our own dai who enlighten by the studi of anthropolog and fascin by what is new and strang some us the languag of fear other of hope ar inclin to believ that a time will come when through the selfassert of women or the rebelli spirit of children by the analysi of human relat or by the forc of outward circumst the ti of famili life mai be broken or greatli relax thei point to societi in america and elsewher which tend to show that the destruct of the famili need not necessarili involv the overthrow of all moral wherev we mai think of such specul we can hardli deni that thei have been more rife in thi gener than in ani other and whither thei ar tend who can predict to the doubt and queri rais by these social reform respect the relat of the sex and the moral natur of man there is a suffici answer if ani is need the differ about them and us is realli on of fact thei ar speak of man as thei wish or fanci him to be but we ar speak of him as he is thei isol the anim part of hi natur we regard him as a

incompat of famili life of the mean of trade of the flatteri of on class of societi by anoth of the impedi which the famili throw in the wai of lofti aim and aspir but we ar consciou that there ar evil and danger in the background greater still which ar not appreci becaus thei ar either conceal or suppress what a condit of man would that be in which human passion were control by no author divin or human in which there wa no shame or decenc no higher affect overcom or sanctifi the natur instinct but simpli a rule of health is it for thi that we ar ask to throw awai the civil which is the growth of ag for strength and health ar not the onli qualiti to be desir there ar the more import consider of mind and charact and soul we know how human natur mai be degrad we do not know how by

peculiar run in famili and again of a tendenc as in the anim to revert to a common or origin stock but we have a difficulti in distinguish what is a true inherit of geniu or other qualiti and what is

circumst or within thi wall of necess we have still the power of creat a life for ourselv by the inform energi of the human will there is anoth aspect of the marriag question to which plato is a stranger all the children born in hi state ar foundl it never occur to him that the greater part of them accord to univers experi would have perish for children can onli be brought up in famili there is a subtl sympathi between the mother and the child which cannot be suppli by other mother or by strong nurs on or more law if plato pen wa as fatal as the crech of pari or the foundl hospit of

protest against the destruct of the famili what plato had heard or seen of sparta wa appli by him in a mistaken wai to hi ideal commonwealth he probabl observ that both the spartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other greek and thi superior he wa dispos to attribut to the law and custom relat to marriag he did not consid that the desir of a nobl offspr wa a passion among the spartan or that their physic superior wa to be attribut chiefli not to their marriag custom but to their temper and train he did not reflect that sparta wa great not in consequ of the relax of moral but in spite of it by virtu of a polit principl stronger far than exist in ani other grecian state least of all did he observ that sparta did not realli produc the finest specimen of the greek race the geniu the polit inspir of athen the love of libertyal that ha made greec famou with poster were want among the spartan thei had no themistocl or pericl or aeschylu or sophocl or socrat or

system which instead of foster the scatter seed or spark of geniu and charact tend to smother and extinguish them still while condemn plato we must acknowledg that neither christian nor ani other form of religion and societi ha hitherto been abl to cope with thi most difficult of social problem and that the side from which plato regard it is that from which we turn awai popul is the most untam forc in the polit and social world do we not find especi in larg citi that the greatest hindranc to the amelior of the poor is their improvid in marriagea small fault truli if not involv endless consequ

ar not oppos physic consider to moral but moral to physic we ar seek to make the voic of reason heard which drive us back from the extravag of sentiment on common sens the late dr comb is said by hi

that a veri few person have done from a sens of duti what the rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumst if thei had allow themselv to think of all the miseri which thei were about to

selfrestraint so great is the danger lest he who would be the counsellor of anoth should reveal the secret prematur lest he should get anoth too much into hi power or fix the pass impress of evil by demand the confess of it nor is plato wrong in assert that famili attach mai interfer with higher aim if there have been some who to parti gave up what wa meant for mankind there have certainli been other who to famili gave up what wa meant for mankind or for their countri the care of children the necess of procur monei for their support the flatteri of the rich by the poor the exclus of cast the pride of birth or wealth the tendenc of famili life to divert men from the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic ar as lower in our own ag as in that of plato and if we prefer to look at the gentl influenc of home the develop of the affect the amen of societi the devot of on member of a famili for the good of the other which form on side of the pictur we must not quarrel with him or perhap ought rather to be grate to him for have present to us the revers without attempt to defend plato on ground of moral we mai allow that there is an aspect of the world which ha not unnatur led him into error we hardli appreci the power which the idea of the state like all other abstract idea exercis over the mind of plato to us the state seem to be built up out of the famili or sometim to be the framework in which famili and social life is contain but to plato in hi present mood of mind the famili is onli a disturb influenc which instead of fill up tend to disarrang the higher uniti of the state no organ is need except a polit which regard from anoth point of view is a militari on the state is allsuff for the want of man and like the idea of the church in later ag absorb all other desir and affect in time of war the thousand citizen ar to stand like a rampart impregn against the world or the persian host in time of peac the prepar for war and their duti to the state which ar also their duti to on anoth take up their whole life and time the onli other interest which is allow to them besid that of war is the interest of philosophi when thei ar too old to be soldier thei ar to retir from activ life and to have a second noviti of studi and contempl there is an element of monastic even in plato commun if he could have done without children he might have convert hi republ into a religi order neither in the law when the daylight of common sens break in upon him doe he retract hi error in the state of which he would be the founder there is no marri or give in marriag but becaus of the infirm of mankind he condescend to allow the law of natur to prevail c but plato ha an equal or in hi own estim even greater paradox in reserv which is sum up in the famou text until king ar philosoph or philosoph ar king citi will never ceas from ill and by philosoph he explain himself to mean those who ar capabl of apprehend idea especi the idea of good to the attain of thi higher knowledg the second educ is direct through a process of train which ha alreadi made them good citizen thei ar now to be made good legisl we find with some surpris not unlik the feel which aristotl in a wellknown passag describ the hearer of plato lectur as experienc when thei went to a discours on the idea of good expect to be instruct in moral truth and receiv instead of them arithmet and mathemat formula that plato doe not propos for hi futur legisl ani studi of financ or law or militari tactic but onli of abstract mathemat as a prepar for the still more abstract concept of good we ask with aristotl what is the us of a man know the idea of good if he doe not know what is good for thi individu thi state thi condit of societi we cannot understand how plato legisl or guardian ar to be fit for their work of statesmen by the studi of the five mathemat scienc we vainli search in plato own write for ani explan of thi seem absurd the discoveri of a great metaphys concept seem to ravish the mind with a prophet conscious which take awai the power of estim it valu no metaphys enquir ha ever fairli criticis hi own specul in hi own judgment thei have been abov critic nor ha he understood that what to him seem to be absolut truth mai reappear in the next gener as a form of logic or an instrument of thought and poster have also sometim equal misapprehend the real valu of hi specul thei appear to them to have contribut noth to the stock of human knowledg the idea of good is apt to be regard by the modern thinker as an unmean abstract but he forget that thi abstract is wait readi for us and will hereaft be fill up by the divis of knowledg when mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law the introduct of the mere concept of law or design or final caus and the faroff anticip of the harmoni of knowledg ar great step onward even the crude gener of the uniti of all thing lead men to view the world with differ ey and mai easili affect their concept of human life and of polit and also their own conduct and charact tim we can imagin how a great mind like that of pericl might deriv elev from hi intercours with anaxagora phaedr to be struggl toward a higher but unattain concept is a more favour intellectu condit than to rest satisfi in a narrow portion of ascertain fact and the earlier which have sometim been the greater idea of scienc ar often lost sight of at a later period how rare can we sai of ani modern enquir in the magnific languag of plato that he is the spectat of all time and of all exist nor is there anyth unnatur in the hasti applic of these vast metaphys concept to practic and polit life in the first enthusiasm of idea men ar apt to see them everywher and to appli them in the most remot sphere thei do not understand that the experi of ag is requir to enabl them to fill up the intermedi axiom plato himself seem to have imagin that the truth of psycholog like those of astronomi and harmon would be arriv at by a process of deduct and that the method which he ha pursu in the fourth book of infer them from experi and the us of languag wa imperfect and onli provision but when after have arriv at the idea of good which is the end of the scienc of dialect he is ask what is the natur and what ar the divis of the scienc he refus to answer as if intend by the refus to intim that the state of knowledg which then exist wa not such as would allow the philosoph to enter into hi final rest the previou scienc must first be studi and will we mai add continu to be studi tell the end of time although in a sens differ from ani which plato could have conceiv but we mai observ that while he is awar of the vacanc of hi own ideal he is full of enthusiasm in the contempl of it look into the orb of light he see noth but he is warm and elev the hebrew prophet believ that faith in god would enabl him to govern the world the greek philosoph imagin that contempl of the good would make a legisl there is as much to be fill up in the on case as in the other and the on mode of concept is to the israelit what the other is to the greek both find a repos in a divin perfect which whether in a more person or imperson form exist without them and independ of them as well as within them there is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeu nor of the divin creator of the world in the republ and we ar natur led to ask in what relat thei stand to on anoth is god abov or below the idea of good or is the idea of good anoth mode of conceiv god the latter appear to be the truer answer to the greek philosoph the perfect and uniti of god wa a far higher concept than hi person which he hardli found a word to express and which to him would have seem to be borrow from mytholog to the christian on the other hand or to the modern thinker in gener it is difficult if not imposs to attach realiti to what he term mere abstract while to plato thi veri abstract is the truest and most real of all thing henc from a differ in form of thought plato appear to be rest on a creation of hi own mind onli but if we mai be allow to paraphras the idea of good by the word intellig principl of law and order in the univers embrac equal man and natur we begin to find a meetingpoint between him and ourselv the question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosoph is on that ha not lost interest in modern time in most countri of europ and asia there ha been some on in the cours of ag who ha truli unit the power of command with the power of thought and reflect as there have been also mani fals combin of these qualiti some kind of specul power is necessari both in practic and polit life like the rhetorician in the phaedru men requir to have a concept of the varieti of human charact and to be rais on great occas abov the commonplac of ordinari life yet the idea of the philosopherstatesman ha never been popular with the mass of mankind partli becaus he cannot take the world into hi confid or make them understand the motiv from which he act and also becaus thei ar jealou of a power which thei do not understand the revolut which human natur desir to effect step by step in mani ag is like to be precipit by him in a singl year or life thei ar afraid that in the pursuit of hi greater aim he mai disregard the common feel of human he is too apt to be look into the distant futur or back into the remot past and unabl to see action or event which to us an express of plato ar tumbl out at hi feet besid as plato would sai there ar other corrupt of these philosoph statesmen either the nativ hue of resolut is sickli oer with the pale cast of thought and at the moment when action abov all thing is requir he is undecid or gener principl ar enunci by him in order to cover some chang of polici or hi ignor of the world ha made him more easili fall a prei to the art of other or in some case he ha been convert into a courtier who enjoi the luxuri of hold liber opinion but wa never known to perform a liber action no wonder that mankind have been in the habit of call statesmen of thi class pedant sophist doctrinair visionari for as we mai be allow to sai a littl parodi the word of plato thei have seen bad imit of the philosopherstatesman but a man in whom the power of thought and action ar perfectli balanc equal to the present reach forward to the futur such a on rule in a constitut state thei have never seen but as the philosoph is apt to fail in the routin of polit life so the ordinari statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinari crise when the face of the world is begin to alter and thunder is heard in the distanc he is still guid by hi old maxim and is the slave of hi inveter parti prejudic he cannot perceiv the sign of the time instead of look forward he look back he learn noth and forget noth with wise saw and modern instanc he would stem the rise tide of revolut he live more and more within the circl of hi own parti as the world without him becom stronger thi seem to be the reason why the old order of thing make so poor a figur when confront with the new why church can never reform why most polit chang ar made blindli and convuls the great crise in the histori of nation have often been met by an ecclesiast posit and a more obstin reassert of principl which have lost their hold upon a nation the fix idea of a reactionari statesman mai be compar to mad thei grow upon him and he becom possess by them no judgement of other is ever admit by him to be weigh in the balanc against hi own d plato labour under what to modern reader appear to have been a confus of idea assimil the state to the individu and fail to distinguish ethic from polit he think that to be most of a state which is most like on man and in which the citizen have the greatest uniform of charact he doe not see that the analog is partli fallaci and that the will or charact of a state or nation is realli the balanc or rather the surplu of individu will which ar limit by the condit of have to act in common the movement of a bodi of men can never have the plianci or facil of a singl man the freedom of the individu which is alwai limit becom still more straiten when transfer to a nation the power of action and feel ar necessarili weaker and more balanc when thei ar diffus through a commun whenc aris the often discuss question can a nation like an individu have a conscienc we hesit to sai that the charact of nation ar noth more than the sum of the charact of the individu who compos them becaus there mai be tendenc in individu which react upon on anoth a whole nation mai be wiser than ani on man in it or mai be anim by some common opinion or feel which could not equal have affect the mind of a singl person or mai have been inspir by a leader of geniu to perform act more than human plato doe not appear to have analys the complic which aris out of the collect action of mankind neither is he capabl of see that analog though speciou as argument mai often have no foundat in fact or of distinguish between what is intellig or vividli present to the mind and what is true in thi respect he is far below aristotl who is compar seldom impos upon by fals analog he cannot disentangl the art from the virtuesat least he is alwai argu from on to the other hi notion of music is transfer from harmoni of sound to harmoni of life in thi he is assist by the ambigu of languag as well as by the preval of pythagorean notion and have onc assimil the state to the individu he imagin that he will find the success of state parallel in the live of individu still through thi fallaci medium a real enlarg of idea is attain when the virtu as yet present no distinct concept to the mind a great advanc wa made by the comparison of them with the art for virtu is partli art and ha an outward form as well as an inward principl the harmoni of music afford a live imag of the harmoni of the world and of human life and mai be regard as a splendid illustr which wa natur mistaken for a real analog in the same wai the identif of ethic with polit ha a tendenc to give definit to ethic and also to elev and ennobl men notion of the aim of govern and of the duti of citizen for ethic from on point of view mai be conceiv as an ideal law and polit and polit as ethic reduc to the condit of human societi there have been evil which have arisen out of the attempt to identifi them and thi ha led to the separ or antagon of them which ha been introduc by modern polit writer but we mai likewis feel that someth ha been lost in their separ and that the ancient philosoph who estim the moral and intellectu wellb of mankind first and the wealth of nation and individu second mai have a salutari influenc on the specul of modern time mani polit maxim origin in a reaction against an opposit error and when the error against which thei were direct have pass awai thei in turn becom error plato view of educ ar in sever respect remark like the rest of the republ thei ar partli greek and partli ideal begin with the ordinari curriculum of the greek youth and extend to afterlif plato is the first writer who distinctli sai that educ is to comprehend the whole of life and to be a prepar for anoth in which educ begin again thi is the continu thread which run through the republ and which more than ani other of hi idea admit of an applic to modern life he ha long given up the notion that virtu cannot be taught and he is dispos to modifi the thesi of the protagora that the virtu ar on and not mani he is not unwil to admit the sensibl world into hi scheme of truth nor doe he assert in the republ the involuntari of vice which is maintain by him in the timaeu sophist and law protag apol gorg nor do the socal platon idea recov from a former state of exist affect hi theori of mental improv still we observ in him the remain of the old socrat doctrin that true knowledg must be elicit from within and is to be sought for in idea not in particular of sens educ as he sai will implant a principl of intellig which is better than ten thousand ey the paradox that the virtu ar on and the kindr notion that all virtu is knowledg ar not entir renounc the first is seen in the supremaci given to justic over the rest the second in the tendenc to absorb the moral virtu in the intellectu and to centr all good in the contempl of the idea of good the world of sens is still depreci and identifi with opinion though admit to be a shadow of the true in the republ he is evid impress with the convict that vice aris chiefli from ignor and mai be cure by educ the multitud ar hardli to be deem respons for what thei do a faint allus to the doctrin of reminisc occur in the tenth book but plato view of educ have no more real connect with a previou state of exist than our own he onli propos to elicit from the mind that which is there alreadi educ is repres by him not as the fill of a vessel but as the turn the ey of the soul toward the light he treat first of music or literatur which he divid into true and fals and then goe on to gymnast of infanc in the republ he take no notic though in the law he give sage counsel about the nurs of children and the manag of the mother and would have an educ which is even prior to birth but in the republ he begin with the ag at which the child is capabl of receiv idea and boldli assert in languag which sound paradox to modern ear that he must be taught the fals befor he can learn the true the modern and ancient philosoph world ar not agre about truth and falsehood the on identifi truth almost exclus with fact the other with idea thi is the differ between ourselv and plato which is howev partli a differ of word for we too should admit that a child must receiv mani lesson which he imperfectli understand he must be taught some thing in a figur onli some too which he can hardli be expect to believ when he grow older but we should limit the us of fiction by the necess of the case plato would draw the line differ accord to him the aim of earli educ is not truth as a matter of fact but truth as a matter of principl the child is to be taught first simpl religi truth and then simpl moral truth and insens to learn the lesson of good manner and good tast he would make an entir reform of the old mytholog like xenophan and heracleitu he is sensibl of the deep chasm which separ hi own ag from homer and hesiod whom he quot and invest with an imaginari author but onli for hi own purpos the lust and treacheri of the god ar to be banish the terror of the world below ar to be dispel the misbehaviour of the homer hero is not to be a model for youth but there is anoth strain heard in homer which mai teach our youth endur and someth mai be learnt in medicin from the simpl practic of the homer ag the principl on which religion is to be base ar two onli first that god is true secondli that he is good modern and christian writer have often fallen short of these thei can hardli be said to have gone beyond them the young ar to be brought up in happi surround out of the wai of sight or sound which mai hurt the charact or vitiat the tast thei ar to live in an atmospher of health the breez is alwai to be waft to them the impress of truth and good could such an educ be realiz or if our modern religi educ could be bound up with truth and virtu and good manner and good tast that would be the best hope of human improv plato like ourselv is look forward to chang in the moral and religi world and is prepar for them he recogn the danger of unsettl young men mind by sudden chang of law and principl by destroi the sacred of on set of idea when there is noth els to take their place he is afraid too of the influenc of the drama on the ground that it encourag fals sentiment and therefor he would not have hi children taken to the theatr he think that the effect on the spectat is bad and on the actor still wors hi idea of educ is that of harmoni growth in which ar insens learnt the lesson of temper and endur and the bodi and mind develop in equal proport the first principl which run through all art and natur is simplic thi also is to be the rule of human life the second stage of educ is gymnast which answer to the period of muscular growth and develop the simplic which is enforc in music is extend to gymnast plato is awar that the train of the bodi mai be inconsist with the train of the mind and that bodili exercis mai be easili overdon excess train of the bodi is apt to give men a headach or to render them sleepi at a lectur on philosophi and thi thei attribut not to the true caus but to the natur of the subject two point ar notic in plato treatment of gymnasticfirst that the time of train is entir separ from the time of literari educ he seem to have thought that two thing of an opposit and differ natur could not be learnt at the same time here we can hardli agre with him and if we mai judg by experi the effect of spend three year between the ag of fourteen and seventeen in mere bodili exercis would be far from improv to the intellect secondli he affirm that music and gymnast ar not as common opinion is apt to imagin intend the on for the cultiv of the mind and the other of the bodi but that thei ar both equal design for the improv of the mind the bodi in hi view is the servant of the mind the subject of the lower to the higher is for the advantag of both and doubtless the mind mai exercis a veri great and paramount influenc over the bodi if exert not at particular moment and by fit and start but continu in make prepar for the whole of life other greek writer saw the mischiev tendenc of spartan disciplin arist pol thuc but onli plato recogn the fundament error on which the practic wa base the subject of gymnast lead plato to the sister subject of medicin which he further illustr by the parallel of law the modern disbelief in medicin ha led in thi as in some other depart of knowledg to a demand for greater simplic physician ar becom awar that thei often make diseas greater and more complic by their treatment of them rep in two thousand year their art ha made but slender progress what thei have gain in the analysi of the part is in a great degre lost by their feebler concept of the human frame as a whole thei have attend more to the cure of diseas than to the condit of health and the improv in medicin have been more than counterbalanc by the disus of regular train until late thei have hardli thought of air and water the import of which wa well understood by the ancient as aristotl remark air and water be the element which we most us have the greatest effect upon health polit for ag physician have been under the dominion of prejudic which have onli recent given wai and now there ar as mani opinion in medicin as in theologi and an equal degre of sceptic and some want of toler about both plato ha sever good notion about medicin accord to him the ey cannot be cure without the rest of the bodi nor the bodi without the mind charm no man of sens he sai in the timaeu would take physic and we heartili sympath with him in the law when he declar that the limb of the rustic worn with toil will deriv more benefit from warm bath than from the prescript of a not over wise doctor but we can hardli prais him when in obedi to the author of homer he depreci diet or approv of the inhuman spirit in which he would get rid of invalid and useless live by leav them to die he doe not seem to have consid that the bridl of theag might be accompani by qualiti which were of far more valu to the state than the health or strength of the citizen or that the duti of take care of the helpless might be an import element of educ in a state the physician himself thi is a delic and subtl observ should not be a man in robust health he should have in modern phraseolog a nervou tempera he should have experi of diseas in hi own person in order that hi power of observ mai be quicken in the case of other the perplex of medicin is parallel by the perplex of law in which again plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplic greater matter ar to be determin by the legisl or by the oracl of delphi lesser matter ar to be left to the temporari regul of the citizen themselv plato is awar that laissez fair is an import element of govern the diseas of a state ar like the head of a hydra thei multipli when thei ar cut off the true remedi for them is not extirp but prevent and the wai to prevent them is to take care of educ and educ will take care of all the rest so in modern time men have often felt that the onli polit measur worth havingth onli on which would produc ani certain or last effect wa a measur of nation educ and in our own more than in ani previou ag the necess ha been recogn of restor the everincreas confus of law to simplic and common sens when the train in music and gymnast is complet there follow the first stage of activ and public life but soon educ is to begin again from a new point of view in the interv between the fourth and seventh book we have discuss the natur of knowledg and have thenc been led to form a higher concept of what wa requir of us for true knowledg accord to plato is of abstract and ha to do not with particular or individu but with univers onli not with the beauti of poetri but with the idea of philosophi and the great aim of educ is the cultiv of the habit of abstract thi is to be acquir through the studi of the mathemat scienc thei alon ar capabl of give idea of relat and of arous the dormant energi of thought mathemat in the ag of plato comprehend a veri small part of that which is now includ in them but thei bore a much larger proport to the sum of human knowledg thei were the onli organon of thought which the human mind at that time possess and the onli measur by which the chao of particular could be reduc to rule and order the faculti which thei train wa natur at war with the poetic or imagin and henc to plato who is everywher seek for abstract and try to get rid of the illus of sens nearli the whole of educ is contain in them thei seem to have an inexhaust applic partli becaus their true limit were not yet understood these plato himself is begin to investig though not awar that number and figur ar mere abstract of sens he recogn that the form us by geometri ar borrow from the sensibl world he seek to find the ultim ground of mathemat idea in the idea of good though he doe not satisfactorili explain the connexion between them and in hi concept of the relat of idea to number he fall veri far short of the definit attribut to him by aristotl met but if he fail to recogn the true limit of mathemat he also reach a point beyond them in hi view idea of number becom secondari to a higher concept of knowledg the dialectician is as much abov the mathematician as the mathematician is abov the ordinari man the on the selfprov the good which is the higher sphere of dialect is the perfect truth to which all thing ascend and in which thei final repos thi selfprov uniti or idea of good is a mere vision of which no distinct explan can be given rel onli to a particular stage in greek philosophi it is an abstract under which no individu ar comprehend a whole which ha no part arist nic eth the vacanc of such a form wa perceiv by aristotl but not by plato nor did he recogn that in the dialect process ar includ two or more method of investig which ar at varianc with each other he did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road no advanc could be made in thi wai and yet such vision often have an immens effect for although the method of scienc cannot anticip scienc the idea of scienc not as it is but as it will be in the futur is a great and inspir principl in the pursuit of knowledg we ar alwai press forward to someth beyond us and as a fals concept of knowledg for exampl the scholast philosophi mai lead men astrai dure mani ag so the true ideal though vacant mai draw all their thought in a right direct it make a great differ whether the gener expect of knowledg as thi indefinit feel mai be term is base upon a sound judgment for mankind mai often entertain a true concept of what knowledg ought to be when thei have but a slender experi of fact the correl of the scienc the conscious of the uniti of natur the idea of classif the sens of proport the unwilling to stop short of certainti or to confound probabl with truth ar import principl of the higher educ although plato could tell us noth and perhap knew that he could tell us noth of the absolut truth he ha exercis an influenc on the human mind which even at the present dai is not exhaust and polit and social question mai yet aris in which the thought of plato mai be read anew and receiv a fresh mean the idea of good is so call onli in the republ but there ar trace of it in other dialogu of plato it is a caus as well as an idea and from thi point of view mai be compar with the creator of the timaeu who out of hi good creat all thing it correspond to a certain extent with the modern concept of a law of natur or of a final caus or of both in on and in thi regard mai be connect with the measur and symmetri of the philebu it is repres in the symposium under the aspect of beauti and is suppos to be attain there by stage of initi as here by regular gradat of knowledg view subject it is the process or scienc of dialect thi is the scienc which accord to the phaedru is the true basi of rhetor which alon is abl to distinguish the natur and class of men and thing which divid a whole into the natur part and reunit the scatter part into a natur or organ whole which defin the abstract essenc or univers idea of all thing and connect them which pierc the veil of hypothes and reach the final caus or first principl of all which regard the scienc in relat to the idea of good thi ideal scienc is the highest process of thought and mai be describ as the soul convers with herself or hold communion with etern truth and beauti and in anoth form is the everlast question and answerth ceaseless interrog of socrat the dialogu of plato ar themselv exampl of the natur and method of dialect view object the idea of good is a power or caus which make the world without us correspond with the world within yet thi world without us is still a world of idea with plato the investig of natur is anoth depart of knowledg and in thi he seek to attain onli probabl conclus timaeu if we ask whether thi scienc of dialect which plato onli half explain to us is more akin to logic or to metaphys the answer is that in hi mind the two scienc ar not as yet distinguish ani more than the subject and object aspect of the world and of man which german philosophi ha reveal to us nor ha he determin whether hi scienc of dialect is at rest or in motion concern with the contempl of absolut be or with a process of develop and evolut modern metaphys mai be describ as the scienc of abstract or as the scienc of the evolut of thought modern logic when pass beyond the bound of mere aristotelian form mai be defin as the scienc of method the germ of both of them is contain in the platon dialect all metaphysician have someth in common with the idea of plato all logician have deriv someth from the method of plato the nearest approach in modern philosophi to the univers scienc of plato is to be found in the hegelian success of moment in the uniti of the idea plato and hegel alik seem to have conceiv the world as the correl of abstract and not imposs thei would have understood on anoth better than ani of their comment understand them swift voyag to laputa have a desir to see those ancient who were most renown for wit and learn i set apart on dai on purpos i propos that homer and aristotl might appear at the head of all their comment but these were so numer that some hundr were forc to attend in the court and outward room of the palac i knew and could distinguish these two hero at first sight not onli from the crowd but from each other homer wa the taller and comeli person of the two walk veri erect for on of hi ag and hi ey were the most quick and pierc i ever beheld aristotl stoop much and made us of a staff hi visag wa meagr hi hair lank and thin and hi voic hollow i soon discov that both of them were perfect stranger to the rest of the compani and had never seen or heard of them befor and i had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless that these comment alwai kept in the most distant quarter from their princip in the lower world through a conscious of shame and guilt becaus thei had so horribl misrepres the mean of these author to poster i introduc didymu and eustathiu to homer and prevail on him to treat them better than perhap thei deserv for he soon found thei want a geniu to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotl wa out of all patienc with the account i gave him of scotu and ramu as i present them to him and he ask them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunc as themselv there is howev a differ between them for wherea hegel is think of all the mind of men as on mind which develop the stage of the idea in differ countri or at differ time in the same countri with plato these gradat ar regard onli as an order of thought or idea the histori of the human mind had not yet dawn upon him mani critic mai be made on plato theori of educ while in some respect he unavoid fall short of modern thinker in other he is in advanc of them he is oppos to the mode of educ which prevail in hi own time but he can hardli be said to have discov new on he doe not see that educ is rel to the charact of individu he onli desir to impress the same form of the state on the mind of all he ha no suffici idea of the effect of literatur on the format of the mind and greatli exagger that of mathemat hi aim is abov all thing to train the reason faculti to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstract to explain and defin gener notion and if possibl to connect them no wonder that in the vacanc of actual knowledg hi follow and at time even he himself should have fallen awai from the doctrin of idea and have return to that branch of knowledg in which alon the relat of the on and mani can be truli seenth scienc of number in hi view both of teach and train he might be style in modern languag a doctrinair after the spartan fashion he would have hi citizen cast in on mould he doe not seem to consid that some degre of freedom a littl wholesom neglect is necessari to strengthen and develop the charact and to give plai to the individu natur hi citizen would not have acquir that knowledg which in the vision of er is suppos to be gain by the pilgrim from their experi of evil on the other hand plato is far in advanc of modern philosoph and theologian when he teach that educ is to be continu through life and will begin again in anoth he would never allow educ of some kind to ceas although he wa awar that the proverbi sai of solon i grow old learn mani thing cannot be appli liter himself ravish with the contempl of the idea of good and delight in solid geometri rep he ha no difficulti in imagin that a lifetim might be pass happili in such pursuit we who know how mani more men of busi there ar in the world than real student or thinker ar not equal sanguin the educ which he propos for hi citizen is realli the ideal life of the philosoph or man of geniu interrupt but onli for a time by practic dutiesa life not for the mani but for the few yet the thought of plato mai not be wholli incap of applic to our own time even if regard as an ideal which can never be realiz it mai have a great effect in elev the charact of mankind and rais them abov the routin of their ordinari occup or profess it is the best form under which we can conceiv the whole of life nevertheless the idea of plato is not easili put into practic for the educ of after life is necessarili the educ which each on give himself men and women cannot be brought togeth in school or colleg at forti or fifti year of ag and if thei could the result would be disappoint the destin of most men is what plato would call the den for the whole of life and with that thei ar content neither have thei teacher or advis with whom thei can take counsel in riper year there is no schoolmast abroad who will tell them of their fault or inspir them with the higher sens of duti or with the ambit of a true success in life no socrat who will convict them of ignor no christ or follow of christ who will reprov them of sin henc thei have a difficulti in receiv the first element of improv which is selfknowledg the hope of youth no longer stir them thei rather wish to rest than to pursu high object a few onli who have come across great men and women or emin teacher of religion and moral have receiv a second life from them and have light a candl from the fire of their geniu the want of energi is on of the main reason why so few person continu to improv in later year thei have not the will and do not know the wai thei never try an experi or look up a point of interest for themselv thei make no sacrific for the sake of knowledg their mind like their bodi at a

seem hardli ever to have attract the attent of plato and aristotl the ancient were familiar with the mutabl of human affair thei could moral over the ruin of citi and the fall of empir plato statesman and sulpiciu letter to cicero by them fate and chanc were deem to be real power almost person and to have had a great share in polit event the wiser of them like thucydid believ that what had been would be again and that a toler idea of the futur could be gather from the past also thei had dream of a golden ag which exist onc upon a time and might still exist in some unknown land or might return again in the remot futur but the regular growth of a state enlighten by experi progress in knowledg improv in the art of which the citizen were educ by the fulfil of polit duti appear never to have come within the rang of their hope and aspir such a state had never been seen and therefor could not be conceiv by them their experi aristot metaph plato law led them to conclud that there had been cycl of civil in which the art had been discov and lost mani time over and citi had been overthrown and rebuilt again and again and delug and volcano and other natur convuls had alter the face of the earth tradit told them of mani destruct of mankind and of the preserv of a remnant the world began again after a delug and wa reconstruct out of the fragment of itself also thei were acquaint with empir of unknown antiqu like the egyptian or assyrian but thei had never seen them grow and could not imagin ani more than we can the state of man which preced them thei were puzzl and awestricken by the egyptian monument of which the form as plato sai not in a figur but liter were ten thousand year old law and thei contrast the antiqu of egypt with their own short memori the earli legend of hella have no real connect with the later histori thei ar at a distanc and the intermedi region is conceal from view there is no road or path which lead from on to the other at the begin of greek histori in the vestibul of the templ is seen stand first of all the figur of the legisl himself the interpret and servant of the god the fundament law which he give ar not suppos to chang with time and circumst the salvat of the state is held rather to depend on the inviol mainten of them thei were sanction by the author of heaven and it wa deem impieti to alter them the desir to maintain them unalt seem to be the origin of what at first sight is veri surpris to usth intoler zeal of plato against innov in religion or polit law although with a happi inconsist he is also will that the law of other countri should be studi and improv in legisl privat commun to the nocturn council law the addit which were made to them in later ag in order to meet the increas complex of affair were still ascrib by a fiction to the origin legisl and the word of such enact at athen were disput over as if thei had been the word of solon himself plato hope to preserv in a later gener the mind of the legisl he would have hi citizen remain within the line which he ha laid down for them he would not harass them with minut regul he would have allow some chang in the law but not chang which would affect the fundament institut of the state such for exampl as would convert an aristocraci into a timocraci or a timocraci into a popular form of govern pass from specul to fact we observ that progress ha been the except rather than the law of human histori and therefor we ar not surpris to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than of ancient date and like the idea of a philosophi of histori is not more than a centuri or two old it seem to have arisen out of the impress left on the human mind by the growth of the roman empir and of the christian church and to be due to the polit and social improv which thei introduc into the world and still more in our own centuri to the ideal of the first french revolut and the triumph of american independ and in a yet greater degre to the vast materi prosper and growth of popul in england and her coloni and in america it is also to be ascrib in a measur to the greater studi of the philosophi of histori the optimist tempera of some great writer ha assist the creation of it while the opposit charact ha led a few to regard the futur of the world as dark the spectat of all time and of all exist see more of the increas purpos which through the ag ran than formerli but to the inhabit of a small state of hella the vision wa necessarili limit like the vallei in which he dwelt there wa no remot past on which hi ey could rest nor ani futur from which the veil wa partli lift up by the analog of histori the narrow of view which to ourselv appear so singular wa to him natur if not unavoid for the relat of the republ to the statesman and the law and the two other work of plato which directli treat of polit see the introduct to the two latter a few gener point of comparison mai be touch upon in thi place and first of the law the republ though probabl written at interv yet speak gener and judg by the indic of thought and style mai be reason ascrib to the middl period of plato life the law ar certainli the work of hi declin year and some portion of them at ani rate seem to have been written in extrem old ag the republ is full of hope and aspir the law bear the stamp of failur and disappoint the on is a finish work which receiv the last touch of the author the other is imperfectli execut and appar unfinish the on ha the grace and beauti of youth the other ha lost the poetic form but ha more of the sever and knowledg of life which is characterist of old ag the most conspicu defect of the law is the failur of dramat power wherea the republ is full of strike contrast of idea and opposit of charact the law mai be said to have more the natur of a sermon the republ of a poem the on is more religi the other more intellectu mani theori of plato such as the doctrin of idea the govern of the world by philosoph ar not found in the law the immort of the soul is first mention in xii the person of socrat ha altogeth disappear the commun of women and children is renounc the institut of common or public meal for women law is for the first time introduc ar pol there remain in the law the old enmiti to the poet who ar iron salut in highflown term and at the same time ar peremptorili order out of the citi if thei ar not will to submit their poem to the censorship of the magistr rep though the work is in most respect inferior there ar a few passag in the law such as the honour due to the soul the evil of licenti or unnatur love the whole of book x religion the dishonesti of retail trade and bequest which come more home to us and contain more of what mai be term the modern element in plato than almost anyth in the republ the relat of the two work to on anoth is veri well given by aristotl in the polit from the side of the law the same or nearli the same object appli to plato later work the law and therefor we had better examin briefli the constitut which is therein describ in the republ socrat ha definit settl in all a few question onli such as the commun of women and children the commun of properti and the constitut of the state the popul is divid into two classeson of husbandmen and the other of warrior from thi latter is taken a third class of counsellor and ruler of the state but socrat ha not determin whether the husbandmen and artist ar to have a share in the govern and whether thei too ar to carri arm and share in militari servic or not he certainli think that the women ought to share in the educ of the guardian and to fight by their side the remaind of the work is fill up with digress foreign to the main subject and with discuss about the educ of the guardian in the law there is hardli anyth but law not much is said about the constitut thi which he had intend to make more of the ordinari type he gradual bring round to the other or ideal form for with the except of the commun of women and properti he suppos everyth to be the same in both state there is to be the same educ the citizen of both ar to live free from servil occup and there ar to be common meal in both the onli differ is that in the law the common meal ar extend to women and the warrior number about but in the republ onli by plato in the law book v from the side of the republ the first and highest form of the state and of the govern and of the law is that in which there prevail most wide the ancient sai that friend have all thing in common whether there is now or ever will be thi communion of women and children and of properti in which the privat and individu is altogeth banish from life and thing which ar by natur privat such as ey and ear and hand have becom common and all men express prais and blame and feel joi and sorrow on the same occas and the law unit the citi to the utmostwheth all thi is possibl or not i sai that no man act upon ani other principl will ever constitut a state more exalt in virtu or truer or better than thi such a state whether inhabit by god or son of god will make them bless who dwell therein and therefor to thi we ar to look for the pattern of the state and to cling to thi and as far as possibl to seek for on which is like thi the state which we have now in hand when creat will be nearest to immort and uniti in the next degre and after that by the grace of god we will complet the third on and we will begin by speak of the natur and origin of the second the compar short work call the statesman or politicu in it style and manner is more akin to the law while in it ideal it rather resembl the republ as far as we can judg by variou indic of languag and thought it must be later than the on and of cours earlier than the other in both the republ and statesman a close connect is maintain between polit and dialect in the statesman enquiri into the principl of method ar interspers with discuss about polit the compar advantag of the rule of law and of a person ar consid and the decis given in favour of a person arist pol but much mai be said on the other side nor is the opposit necessari for a person mai rule by law and law mai be so appli as to be the live voic of the legisl as in the republ there is a myth describ howev not a futur but a former exist of mankind the question is ask whether the state of innoc which is describ in the myth or a state like our own which possess art and scienc and distinguish good from evil is the prefer condit of man to thi question of the compar happi of civil and primit life which wa so often discuss in the last centuri and in our own no answer is given the statesman though less perfect in style than the republ and of far less rang mai justli be regard as on of the greatest of plato dialogu other as well as plato have chosen an ideal republ to be the vehicl of thought which thei could not definit express or which went beyond their own ag the classic write which approach most nearli to the republ of plato is the de republica of cicero but neither in thi nor in ani other of hi dialogu doe he rival the art of plato the manner ar clumsi and inferior the hand of the rhetorician is appar at everi turn yet nobl sentiment ar constantli recur the true note of roman patriotismw roman ar a great peopleresound through the whole work like socrat cicero turn awai from the phenomena of the heaven to civil and polit life he would rather not discuss the two sun of which all rome wa talk when he can convers about the two nation in on which had divid rome ever sinc the dai of the gracchi like socrat again speak in the person of scipio he is afraid lest he should assum too much the charact of a teacher rather than of an equal who is discuss among friend the two side of a question he would confin the term king or state to the rule of reason and justic and he will not conced that titl either to a democraci or to a monarchi but under the rule of reason and justic he is will to includ the natur superior rule over the natur inferior which he compar to the soul rule over the bodi he prefer a mixtur of form of govern to ani singl on the two portrait of the just and the unjust which occur in the second book of the republ ar transfer to the statephilu on of the interlocutor maintain against hi will the necess of injustic as a principl of govern while the other laeliu support the opposit thesi hi view of languag and number ar deriv from plato like him he denounc the drama he also declar that if hi life were to be twice as long he would have no time to read the lyric poet the pictur of democraci is translat by him word for word though he had hardli shown himself abl to carri the jest of plato he convert into a state sentenc the humor fanci about the anim who ar so imbu with the spirit of democraci that thei make the passersbi get out of their wai hi descript of the tyrant is imit from plato but is far inferior the second book is histor and claim for the roman constitut which is to him the ideal a foundat of fact such as plato probabl intend to have given to the republ in the critia hi most remark imit of plato is the adapt of the vision of er which is convert by cicero into the somnium scipioni he ha roman the myth of the republ ad an argument for the immort of the soul taken from the phaedru and some other touch deriv from the phaedo and the timaeu though a beauti tale and contain splendid passag the somnium scipioni is veri inferior to the vision of er it is onli a dream and hardli allow the reader to suppos that the writer believ in hi own creation whether hi dialogu were frame on the model of the lost dialogu of aristotl as he himself tell us or of plato to which thei bear mani superfici resembl he is still the roman orat he is not convers but make speech and is never abl to mould the intract latin to the grace and eas of the greek platon dialogu but if he is defect in form much more is he inferior to the greek in matter he nowher in hi philosoph write leav upon our mind the impress of an origin thinker plato republ ha been said to be a church and not a state and such an ideal of a citi in the heaven ha alwai hover over the christian world and is embodi in st augustin de civit dei which is suggest by the decai and fall of the roman empir much in the same manner in which we mai imagin the republ of plato to have been influenc by the declin of greek polit in the writer own ag the differ is that in the time of plato the degeneraci though certain wa gradual and insens wherea the take of rome by the goth stir like an earthquak the ag of st augustin men were inclin to believ that the overthrow of the citi wa to be ascrib to the anger felt by the old roman deiti at the neglect of their worship st augustin maintain the opposit thesi he argu that the destruct of the roman empir is due not to the rise of christian but to the vice of pagan he wander over roman histori and over greek philosophi and mytholog and find everywher crime impieti and falsehood he compar the worst part of the gentil religion with the best element of the faith of christ he show noth of the spirit which led other of the earli christian father to recogn in the write of the greek philosoph the power of the divin truth he trace the parallel of the kingdom of god that is the histori of the jew contain in their scriptur and of the kingdom of the world which ar found in gentil writer and pursu them both into an ideal futur it need hardli be remark that hi us both of greek and of roman historian and of the sacr write of the jew is wholli uncrit the heathen mytholog the sybillin oracl the myth of plato the dream of neoplatonist ar equal regard by him as matter of fact he must be acknowledg to be a strictli polem or controversi writer who make the best of everyth on on side and the worst of everyth on the other he ha no sympathi with the old roman life as plato ha with greek life nor ha he ani idea of the ecclesiast kingdom which wa to aris out of the ruin of the roman empir he is not blind to the defect of the christian church and look forward to a time when christian and pagan shall be alik brought befor the judgmentseat and the true citi of god shall appearth work of st augustin is a curiou repertori of antiquarian learn and quotat deepli penetr with christian ethic but show littl power of reason and a slender knowledg of the greek literatur and languag he wa a great geniu and a nobl charact yet hardli capabl of feel or understand anyth extern to hi own theologi of all the ancient philosoph he is most attract by plato though he is veri slightli acquaint with hi write he is inclin to believ that the idea of creation in the timaeu is deriv from the narr in genesi and he is strang taken with the coincid of plato sai that the philosoph is the lover of god and the word of the book of exodu in which god reveal himself to mose exod he dwell at length on miracl perform in hi own dai of which the evid is regard by him as irresist he speak in a veri interest manner of the beauti and util of natur and of the human frame which he conceiv to afford a foretast of the heavenli state and of the resurrect of the bodi the book is not realli what to most person the titl of it would impli and belong to an ag which ha pass awai but it contain mani fine passag and thought which ar for all time the short treatis de monarchia of dant is by far the most remark of mediaev ideal and bear the impress of the great geniu in whom itali and the middl ag ar so vividli reflect it is the vision of an univers empir which is suppos to be the natur and necessari govern of the world have a divin author distinct from the papaci yet coextens with it it is not the ghost of the dead roman empir sit crown upon the grave thereof but the legitim heir and successor of it justifi by the ancient virtu of the roman and the benefic of their rule their right to be the governor of the world is also confirm by the testimoni of miracl and acknowledg by st paul when he appeal to caesar and even more emphat by christ himself who could not have made aton for the sin of men if he had not been condemn by a divin author tribun the necess for the establish of an univers empir is prove partli by a priori argument such as the uniti of god and the uniti of the famili or nation partli by pervers of scriptur and histori by fals analog of natur by misappli quotat from the classic and by odd scrap and commonplac of logic show a familiar but by no mean exact knowledg of aristotl of plato there is none but a more convinc argument still is the miser state of the world which he touchingli describ he see no hope of happi or peac for mankind until all nation of the earth ar comprehend in a singl empir the whole treatis show how deepli the idea of the roman empir wa fix in the mind of hi contemporari not much argument wa need to maintain the truth of a theori which to hi own contemporari seem so natur and congeni he speak or rather preach from the point of view not of the ecclesiast but of the layman although as a good cathol he is will to acknowledg that in certain respect the empir must submit to the church the begin and end of all hi nobl reflect and of hi argument good and bad is the aspir that in thi littl plot of earth belong to mortal man life mai pass in freedom and peac so inextric is hi vision of the futur bound up with the belief and circumst of hi own ag the utopia of sir thoma more is a surpris monument of hi geniu and show a reach of thought far beyond hi contemporari the book wa written by him at the ag of about or and is full of the gener sentiment of youth he bring the light of plato to bear upon the miser state of hi own countri live not long after the war of the rose and in the dreg of the cathol church in england he is indign at the corrupt of the clergi at the luxuri of the nobil and gentri at the suffer of the poor at the calam caus by war to the ey of more the whole world wa in dissolut and decai and side by side with the miseri and oppress which he ha describ in the first book of the utopia he place in the second book the ideal state which by the help of plato he had construct the time were full of stir and intellectu interest the distant murmur of the reform wa begin to be heard to mind like more greek literatur wa a revel there had arisen an art of interpret and the new testament wa begin to be understood as it had never been befor and ha not often been sinc in it natur sens the life there depict appear to him wholli unlik that of christian commonwealth in which he saw noth but a certain conspiraci of rich men procur their own commod under the name and titl of the commonwealth he thought that christ like plato institut all thing common for which reason he tell us the citizen of utopia were the more will to receiv hi doctrin howbeit i think thi wa no small help and further in the matter that thei heard us sai that christ institut among hi all thing common and that the same commun doth yet remain in the rightest christian commun utopia the commun of properti is a fix idea with him though he is awar of the argument which mai be urg on the other side these thing i sai when i consid with myself i hold well with plato and do noth marvel that he would make no law for them that refus those law wherebi all men should have and enjoi equal portion of rich and commod for the wise men did easili forese thi to be the on and onli wai to the wealth of a commun if equal of all thing should be brought in and establish utopia we wonder how in the reign of henri viii though veil in anoth languag and publish in a foreign countri such specul could have been endur he is gift with far greater dramat invent than ani on who succeed him with the except of swift in the art of feign he is a worthi discipl of plato like him start from a small portion of fact he found hi tale with admir skill on a few line in the latin narr of the voyag of amerigo vespucci he is veri precis about date and fact and ha the power of make us believ that the narrat of the tale must have been an eyewit we ar fairli puzzl by hi manner of mix up real and imaginari person hi boi john clement and peter gile citizen of antwerp with whom he disput about the precis word which ar suppos to have been us by the imaginari portugues travel raphael hythlodai i have the more caus sai hythlodai to fear that my word shall not be believ for that i know how difficultli and hardli i myself would have believ anoth man tell the same if i had not myself seen it with mine own ey or again if you had been with me in utopia and had present seen their fashion and law as i did which live there five year and more and would never have come thenc but onli to make the new land known here etc more greatli regret that he forgot to ask hythlodai in what part of the world utopia is situat he would have spent no small sum of monei rather than it should have escap him and he beg peter gile to see hythlodai or write to him and obtain an answer to the question after thi we ar not surpris to hear that a professor of divin perhap a late famou vicar of croydon in surrei as the translat think is desir of be sent thither as a missionari by the high bishop yea and that he mai himself be made bishop of utopia noth doubt that he must obtain thi bishopr with suit and he counteth that a godli suit which proceedeth not of the desir of honour or lucr but onli of a godli zeal the design mai have fail through the disappear of hythlodai concern whom we have veri uncertain new after hi departur there is no doubt howev that he had told more and gile the exact situat of the island but unfortun at the same moment more attent as he is remind in a letter from gile wa drawn off by a servant and on of the compani from a cold caught on shipboard cough so loud as to prevent gile from hear and the secret ha perish with him to thi dai the place of utopia remain unknown the word of phaedru o socrat you can easili invent egyptian or anyth ar recal to our mind as we read thi lifelik fiction yet the greater merit of the work is not the admir art but the origin of thought more is as free as plato from the prejudic of hi ag and far more toler the utopian do not allow him who believ not in the immort of the soul to share in the administr of the state law howbeit thei put him to no punish becaus thei be persuad that it is in no man power to believ what he list and no man is to be blame for reason in support of hi own religion on of our compani in my presenc wa sharpli punish he as soon as he wa baptis began against our will with more earnest affect than wisdom to reason of christ religion and began to wax so hot in hi matter that he did not onli prefer our religion befor all other but also did despis and condemn all other call them profan and the follow of them wick and devilish and the children of everlast damnat when he had thu long reason the matter thei laid hold on him accus him and condemn him into exil not as a despis of religion but as a sediti person and a raiser up of dissens among the peopl in the public servic no prayer be us but such as everi man mai boldli pronounc without give offenc to ani sect he sai significantli there be that give worship to a man that wa onc of excel virtu or of famou glori not onli as god but also the chiefest and highest god but the most and the wisest part reject all these believ that there is a certain godli power unknown far abov the capac and reach of man wit dispers throughout all the world not in big but in virtu and power him thei call the father of all to him alon thei attribut the begin the increas the proceed the chang and the end of all thing neither give thei ani divin honour to ani other than him so far wa more from share the popular belief of hi time yet at the end he remind us that he doe not in all respect agre with the custom and opinion of the utopian which he describ and we should let him have the benefit of thi save claus and not rude withdraw the veil behind which he ha been pleas to conceal himself nor is he less in advanc of popular opinion in hi polit and moral specul he would like to bring militari glori into contempt he would set all sort of idl peopl to profit occup includ in the same class priest women noblemen gentlemen and sturdi and valiant beggar that the labour of all mai be reduc to six hour a dai hi dislik of capit punish and plan for the reform of offend hi detest of priest and lawyer compar hi satir observ thei the utopian have priest of exceed holi and therefor veri few hi remark that although everi on mai hear of raven dog and wolv and cruel maneat it is not easi to find state that ar well and wise govern ar curious at varianc with the notion of hi ag and inde with hi own life there ar mani point in which he show a modern feel and a prophet insight like plato he is a sanitari reform he maintain that civil state have a right to the soil of wast countri he is inclin to the opinion which place happi in virtuou pleasur but herein as he think not disagre from those other philosoph who defin virtu to be a life accord to natur he extend the idea of happi so as to includ the happi of other and he argu ingeni all men agre that we ought to make other happi but if other how much more ourselv and still he think that there mai be a more excel wai but to thi no man reason can attain unless heaven should inspir him with a higher truth hi ceremoni befor marriag hi human propos that war should be carri on by assassin the leader of the enemi mai be compar to some of the paradox of plato he ha a charm fanci like the affin of greek and barbarian in the timaeu that the utopian learnt the languag of the greek with the more readi becaus thei were origin of the same race with them he is penetr with the spirit of plato and quot or adapt mani thought both from the republ and from the timaeu he prefer public duti to privat and is somewhat impati of the importun of relat hi citizen have no silver or gold of their own but ar readi enough to pai them to their mercenari there is noth of which he is more contemptu than the love of monei gold is us for fetter of crimin and diamond and pearl for children necklac when the ambassador came arrai in gold and peacock feather to the ey of all the utopian except veri few which had been in other countri for some reason caus all that gorgeous of apparel seem shame and reproach in so much that thei most rever salut the vilest and most abject of them for lordspass over the ambassador themselv without ani honour judg them by their wear of golden chain to be bondmen you should have seen children also that had cast awai their pearl and preciou stone when thei saw the like stick upon the ambassador cap dig and push their mother under the side sai thu to themlook though he were a littl child still but the mother yea and that also in good earnest peac son saith she i think he be some of the ambassador fool like plato he is full of satir reflect on govern and princ on the state of the world and of knowledg the hero of hi discours hythlodai is veri unwil to becom a minist of state consid that he would lose hi independ and hi advic would never be heed compar an exquisit passag of which the conclus is as follow and verili it is natur givensuppress and end he ridicul the new logic of hi time the utopian could never be made to understand the doctrin of second intent for thei have not devis on of all those rule of restrict amplif and supposit veri wittili invent in the small logic which here our children in everi place do learn furthermor thei were never yet abl to find out the second intent insomuch that none of them all could ever see man himself in common as thei call him though he be as you know bigger than wa ever ani giant yea and point to of us even with our finger he is veri sever on the sport of the gentri the utopian count hunt the lowest the vilest and the most abject part of butcheri he quot the word of the republ in which the philosoph is describ stand out of the wai under a wall until the drive storm of sleet and rain be overpast which admit of a singular applic to more own fate although write twenti year befor about the year he can hardli be suppos to have foreseen thi there is no touch of satir which strike deeper than hi quiet remark that the greater part of the precept of christ ar more at varianc with the live of ordinari christian than the discours of utopia and yet the most part of them is more dissid from the manner of the world now a dai than my commun wa but preacher sly and wili men follow your counsel as i suppos becaus thei saw men evilwil to frame their manner to christ rule thei have wrest and wri hi doctrin and like a rule of lead have appli it to men manner that by some mean at the least wai thei might agre togeth the new atlanti is onli a fragment and far inferior in merit to the utopia the work is full of ingenu but want in creativ fanci and by no mean impress the reader with a sens of credibl in some place lord bacon is characterist differ from sir thoma more as for exampl in the extern state which he attribut to the governor of solomon hous whose dress he minut describ while to sir thoma more such trap appear simpl ridicul yet after thi programm of dress bacon add the beauti trait that he had a look as though he piti men sever thing ar borrow by him from the timaeu but he ha injur the uniti of style by ad thought and passag which ar taken from the hebrew scriptur the citi of the sun written by campanella a dominican friar sever year after the new atlanti of bacon ha mani resembl to the republ of plato the citizen have wive and children in common their marriag ar of the same temporari sort and ar arrang by the magistr from

life of the apostl is greatli admir by thi peopl becaus thei had all thing in common and the short prayer which jesu christ taught men is us in their worship it is a duti of the chief magistr to pardon sin and therefor the whole peopl make secret confess of them to the magistr and thei to their chief who is a sort of rector metaphysicu and by thi mean he is well inform of all that is go on in the mind of men after confess absolut is grant to the citizen collect but no on is mention by name there also exist among them a practic of perpetu prayer perform by a success of priest who chang everi hour their religion is a worship of god in triniti that is of wisdom love and power but without ani distinct of person thei behold in the sun the reflect of hi glori mere graven imag thei reject refus to fall under the tyranni of idolatri mani detail ar given about their custom of eat and drink about their mode of dress their employ their war campanella look forward to a new mode of educ

not realli know that on ani more than the rest and insist strongli on the necess of a varieti of knowledg more scholar ar turn out in the citi of the sun in on year than by contemporari method in ten or fifteen he evid believ like bacon that henceforward natur scienc will plai a great part in educ a hope which seem hardli to have been realiz either in our own or in ani former ag at ani rate the fulfil of it ha been long defer there is a good deal of ingenu and even origin in thi work and a most enlighten spirit pervad it but it ha littl or no charm of style and fall veri far short of the new atlanti of bacon and still more of the utopia of sir thoma more it is full of inconsist and though borrow from plato show but a superfici acquaint with hi write it is a work such as on might expect to have been written by a philosoph and man of geniu who wa also a friar and who had spent twentyseven year of hi life in a prison of the inquisit the most interest featur of the book common to plato and sir thoma more is the deep feel which is shown by the writer of the miseri and ignor prevail among the lower class in hi own time campanella take note of aristotl answer to plato commun of properti that in a societi where all thing ar common no individu would have ani motiv to work arist pol he repli that hi citizen be happi and content in themselv thei ar requir to work onli four hour a dai will have greater regard for their fellow than exist among men at present he think like plato that if he abolish privat feel and interest a great public feel will take their place other write on ideal state such as the oceana of harrington in which the lord archon mean cromwel is describ not as he wa but as he ought to have been or the argeni of barclai which is an histor allegori of hi own time ar too unlik plato to be worth mention more interest than either of these and far more platon in style and thought is sir john eliot monarchi of man in which the prison of the tower no longer abl to be a politician in the land of hi birth turn awai from polit to view that other citi which is within him and find on the veri threshold of the grave that the secret of human happi is the masteri of self the chang of govern in the time of the english commonwealth set men think about first principl and gave rise to mani work of thi classth great origin geniu of swift ow noth to plato nor is there ani trace in the convers or in the work of dr johnson of ani acquaint with hi write he probabl would have refut plato without read him in the same fashion in which he suppos himself to have refut bishop berkelei theori of the nonexist of matter if we except the socal english platonist or rather neoplatonist who never understood their master and the write of coleridg who wa to some extent a kindr spirit plato ha left no perman impress on english literatur human life and conduct ar affect by ideal in the same wai that thei ar affect by the exampl of emin men neither the on nor the other ar immedi applic to practic but there is a virtu flow from them which tend to rais individu abov the common routin of societi or trade and to elev state abov the mere interest of commerc or the necess of selfdef like the ideal of art thei ar partli frame by the omiss of particular thei requir to be view at a certain distanc and ar apt to fade awai if we attempt to approach them thei gain an imaginari distinct when embodi in a state or in a system of philosophi but thei still remain the vision of a world unreal more strike and obviou to the ordinari mind ar the exampl of great men who have serv their own gener and ar rememb in anoth even in our own famili circl there mai have been some on a woman or even a child in whose face ha shone forth a good more than human the ideal then approach nearer to us and we fondli cling to it the ideal of the past whether of our own past live or of former state of societi ha a singular fascin for the mind of mani too late we learn that such ideal cannot be recal though the recollect of them mai have a human influenc on other time but the abstract of philosophi ar to most person cold and vacant thei give light without warmth thei ar like the full moon in the heaven when there ar no star appear men cannot live by thought alon the world of sens is alwai break in upon them thei ar for the most part confin to a corner of earth and see but a littl wai beyond their own home or place of abod thei do not lift up their ey to the hill thei ar not awak when the dawn appear but in plato we have reach a height from which a man mai look into the distanc and behold the futur of the world and of philosophi the ideal of the state and of the life of the philosoph the ideal of an educ continu through life and extend equal to both sex the ideal of the uniti and correl of knowledg the faith in good and immortalityar the vacant form of light on which plato is seek to fix the ey of mankind two other ideal which never appear abov the horizon in greek philosophi float befor the mind of men in our own dai on seen more clearli than formerli as though each year and each gener brought us nearer to some great chang the other almost in the same degre retir from view behind the law of natur as if oppress by them but still remain a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the heart of man the first ideal is the futur of the human race in thi world the second the futur of the individu in anoth the first is the more perfect realiz of our own present life the second the abneg of it the on limit by experi the other transcend it both of them have been and ar power motiv of action there ar a few in whom thei have taken the place of all earthli interest the hope of a futur for the human race at first sight seem to be the more disinterest the hope of individu exist the more egotist of the two motiv but when men have learn to resolv their hope of a futur either for themselv or for the world into the will of godnot my will but thine the differ between them fall awai and thei mai be allow to make either of them the basi of their live accord to their own individu charact or tempera there is as much faith in the willing to work for an unseen futur in thi world as in anoth neither is it inconceiv that some rare natur mai feel hi duti to anoth gener or to anoth centuri almost as strongli as to hi own or that live alwai in the presenc of god he mai realiz anoth world as vividli as he doe thi the greatest of all ideal mai or rather must be conceiv by us under similitud deriv from human qualiti although sometim like the jewish prophet we mai dash awai these figur of speech and describ the natur of god onli in neg these again by degre acquir a posit mean it would be well if when medit on the higher truth either of philosophi or religion we sometim substitut on form of express for anoth lest through the necess of languag we should becom the slave of mere word there is a third ideal not the same but akin to these which ha a place in the home and heart of everi believ in the religion of christ and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth the divin man the son of man the saviour of mankind who is the firstborn and head of the whole famili in heaven and earth in whom the divin and human that which is without and that which is within the rang of our earthli faculti ar indissolubl unit neither is thi divin form of good wholli separ from the ideal of the christian church which is said in the new testament to be hi bodi or at varianc with those other imag of good which plato set befor us we see him in a figur onli and of figur of speech we select but a few and those the simplest to be the express of him we behold him in a pictur but he is not there we gather up the fragment of hi discours but neither do thei repres him as he truli wa hi dwell is neither in heaven nor earth but in the heart of man thi is that imag which plato saw dimli in the distanc which when exist among men he call in the languag of homer the like of god the like of a natur which in all ag men have felt to be greater and better than themselv and which in endless form whether deriv from scriptur or natur from the wit of histori or from the human heart regard as a person or not as a person with or without part or passion exist in space or not in space is and will alwai continu to be to mankind the idea of good the republ person of the dialogu socrat who is the narrat glaucon adeimantu polemarchu cephalu thrasymachu cleitophon and other who ar mute auditor the scene is laid in the hous of cephalu at the piraeu and the whole dialogu is narrat by socrat the dai after it actual took place to timaeu hermocr critia and a nameless person who ar introduc in the timaeu book i i went down yesterdai to the piraeu with glaucon the son of ariston that i might offer up my prayer to the goddess bendi the thracian artemi and also becaus i want to see in what manner thei would celebr the festiv which wa a new thing i wa delight with the process of the inhabit but that of the thracian wa equal if not more beauti when we had finish our prayer and view the spectacl we turn in the direct of the citi and at that instant polemarchu the son of cephalu chanc to catch sight of us from a distanc as we were start on our wai home and told hi servant to run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by the cloak behind and said polemarchu desir you to wait i turn round and ask him where hi master wa there he is said the youth come after you if you will onli wait certainli we will said glaucon and in a few minut polemarchu appear and with him adeimantu glaucon brother niceratu the son of nicia and sever other who had been at the process polemarchu said to me i perceiv socrat that you and your companion ar alreadi on your wai to the citi you ar not far wrong i said but do you see he rejoin how mani we ar of cours and ar you stronger than all these for if not you will have to remain where you ar mai there not be the altern i said that we mai persuad you to let us go but can you persuad us if we refus to listen to you he said certainli not repli glaucon then we ar not go to listen of that you mai be assur adeimantu ad ha no on told you of the torchrac on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the even with hors i repli that is a novelti will horsemen carri torch and pass them on to anoth dure the race ye said polemarchu and not onli so but a festiv will be celebr at night which you certainli ought to see let us rise soon after supper and see thi festiv there will be a gather of young men and we will have a good talk stai then and do not be pervers glaucon said i suppos sinc you insist that we must veri good i repli accordingli we went with polemarchu to hi hous and there we found hi brother lysia and euthydemu and with them thrasymachu the chalcedonian charmantid the paeanian and cleitophon the son of aristonymu there too wa cephalu the father of polemarchu whom i had not seen for a long time and i thought him veri much ag he wa seat on a cushion chair and had a garland on hi head for he had been sacrif in the court and there were some other chair in the room arrang in a semicircl upon which we sat down by him he salut me eagerli and then he said you dont come to see me socrat as often as you ought if i were still abl to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but at my ag i can hardli get to the citi and therefor you should come often to the piraeu for let me tell you that the more the pleasur of the bodi fade awai the greater to me is the pleasur and charm of convers do not then deni my request but make our hous your resort and keep compani with these young men we ar old friend and you will be quit at home with us i repli there is noth which for my part i like better cephalu than convers with ag men for i regard them as travel who have gone a journei which i too mai have to go and of whom i ought to enquir whether the wai is smooth and easi or rug and difficult and thi is a question which i should like to ask of you who have arriv at that time which the poet call the threshold of old agei life harder toward the end or what report do you give of it i will tell you socrat he said what my own feel is men of my ag flock togeth we ar bird of a feather as the old proverb sai and at our meet the tale of my acquaint commonli isi cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasur of youth and love ar fled awai there wa a good time onc but now that is gone and life is no longer life some complain of the slight which ar put upon them by relat and thei will tell you sadli of how mani evil their old ag is the caus but to me socrat these complain seem to blame that which is not realli in fault for if old ag were the caus i too be old and everi other old man would have felt as thei do but thi is not my own experi nor that of other whom i have known how well i rememb the ag poet sophocl when in answer to the question how doe love suit with ag sophoclesar you still the man you were peac he repli most gladli have i escap the thing of which you speak i feel as if i had escap from a mad and furiou master hi word have often occur to my mind sinc and thei seem as good to me now as at the time when he utter them for certainli old ag ha a great sens of calm and freedom when the passion relax their hold then as sophocl sai we ar freed from the grasp not of on mad master onli but of mani the truth is socrat that these regret and also the complaint about relat ar to be attribut to the same caus which is not old ag but men charact and temper for he who is of a calm and happi natur will hardli feel the pressur of ag but to him who is of an opposit disposit youth and ag ar equal a burden i listen in admir and want to draw him out that he might go ony cephalu i said but i rather suspect that peopl in gener ar not convinc by you when you speak thu thei think that old ag sit lightli upon you not becaus of your happi disposit but becaus you ar rich and wealth is well known to be a great comfort you ar right he repli thei ar not convinc and there is someth in what thei sai not howev so much as thei imagin i might answer them as themistocl answer the seriphian who wa abus him and sai that he wa famou not for hi own merit but becaus he wa an athenian if you had been a nativ of my countri or i of your neither of us would have been famou and to those who ar not rich and ar impati of old ag the same repli mai be made for to the good poor man old ag cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich man ever have peac with himself mai i ask cephalu whether your fortun wa for the most part inherit or acquir by you acquir socrat do you want to know how much i acquir in the art of make monei i have been midwai between my father and grandfath for my grandfath whose name i bear doubl and trebl the valu of hi patrimoni that which he inherit be much what i possess now but my father lysania reduc the properti below what it is at present and i shall be satisfi if i leav to these my son not less but a littl more than i receiv that wa why i ask you the question i repli becaus i see that you ar indiffer about monei which is a characterist rather of those who have inherit their fortun than of those who have acquir them the maker of fortun have a second love of monei as a creation of their own resembl the affect of author for their own poem or of parent for their children besid that natur love of it for the sake of us and profit which is common to them and all men and henc thei ar veri bad compani for thei can talk about noth but the prais of wealth that is true he said ye that is veri true but mai i ask anoth questionwhat do you consid to be the greatest bless which you have reap from your wealth on he said of which i could not expect easili to convinc other for let me tell you socrat that when a man think himself to be near death fear and care enter into hi mind which he never had befor the tale of a world below and the punish which is exact there of deed done here were onc a laugh matter to him but now he is torment with the thought that thei mai be true either from the weak of ag or becaus he is now draw nearer to that other place he ha a clearer view of these thing suspicion and alarm crowd thickli upon him and he begin to reflect and consid what wrong he ha done to other and when he find that the sum of hi transgress is great he will mani a time like a child start up in hi sleep for fear and he is fill with dark forebod but to him who is consciou of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingli sai is the kind nurs of hi ag hope he sai cherish the soul of him who live in justic and holi and is the nurs of hi ag and the companion of hi journeyhop which is mightiest to swai the restless soul of man how admir ar hi word and the great bless of rich i do not sai to everi man but to a good man is that he ha had no occas to deceiv or to defraud other either intention or unintention and when he depart to the world below he is not in ani apprehens about offer due to the god or debt which he ow to men now to thi peac of mind the possess of wealth greatli contribut and therefor i sai that set on thing against anoth of the mani advantag which wealth ha to give to a man of sens thi is in my opinion the greatest well said cephalu i repli but as concern justic what is itto speak the truth and to pai your debtsno more than thi and even to thi ar there not except suppos that a friend when in hi right mind ha deposit arm with me and he ask for them when he is not in hi right mind ought i to give them back to him no on would sai that i ought or that i should be right in do so ani more than thei would sai that i ought alwai to speak the truth to on who is in hi condit you ar quit right he repli but then i said speak the truth and pai your debt is not a correct definit of justic quit correct socrat if simonid is to be believ said polemarchu interpos i fear said cephalu that i must go now for i have to look after the sacrific and i hand over the argument to polemarchu and the compani is not polemarchu your heir i said to be sure he answer and went awai laugh to the sacrific tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonid sai and accord to you truli sai about justic he said that the repay of a debt is just and in sai so he appear to me to be right i should be sorri to doubt the word of such a wise and inspir man but hi mean though probabl clear to you is the revers of clear to me for he certainli doe not mean as we were just now sai that i ought to return a deposit of arm or of anyth els to on who ask for it when he is not in hi right sens and yet a deposit cannot be deni to be a debt true then when the person who ask me is not in hi right mind i am by no mean to make the return certainli not when simonid said that the repay of a debt wa justic he did not mean to includ that case certainli not for he think that a friend ought alwai to do good to a friend and never evil you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuri of the receiv if the two parti ar friend is not the repay of a debtthat is what you would imagin him to sai ye and ar enemi also to receiv what we ow to them to be sure he said thei ar to receiv what we ow them and an enemi as i take it ow to an enemi that which is due or proper to himthat is to sai evil simonid then after the manner of poet would seem to have spoken darkli of the natur of justic for he realli meant to sai that justic is the give to each man what is proper to him and thi he term a debt that must have been hi mean he said by heaven i repli and if we ask him what due or proper thing is given by medicin and to whom what answer do you think that he would make to us he would sure repli that medicin give drug and meat and drink to human bodi and what due or proper thing is given by cookeri and to what season to food and what is that which justic give and to whom if socrat we ar to be guid at all by the analog of the preced instanc then justic is the art which give good to friend and evil to enemi that is hi mean then i think so and who is best abl to do good to hi friend and evil to hi enemi in time of sick the physician or when thei ar on a voyag amid the peril of the sea the pilot and in what sort of action or with a view to what result is the just man most abl to do harm to hi enemi and good to hi friend in go to war against the on and in make allianc with the other but when a man is well my dear polemarchu there is no need of a physician no and he who is not on a voyag ha no need of a pilot no then in time of peac justic will be of no us i am veri far from think so you think that justic mai be of us in peac as well as in war ye like husbandri for the acquisit of corn ye or like shoemak for the acquisit of shoesthat is what you mean ye and what similar us or power of acquisit ha justic in time of peac in contract socrat justic is of us and by contract you mean partnership exactli but is the just man or the skil player a more us and better partner at a game of draught the skil player and in the lai of brick and stone is the just man a more us or better partner than the builder quit the revers then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harpplay as in plai the harp the harpplay is certainli a better partner than the just man in a monei partnership ye polemarchu but sure not in the us of monei for you do not want a just man to be your counsellor in the purchas or sale of a hors a man who is know about hors would be better for that would he not certainli and when you want to bui a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be better true then what is that joint us of silver or gold in which the just man is to be prefer when you want a deposit to be kept safe you mean when monei is not want but allow to lie precis that is to sai justic is us when monei is useless that is the infer and when you want to keep a pruninghook safe then justic is us to the individu and to the state but when you want to us it then the art of the vinedress clearli and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to us them you would sai that justic is us but when you want to us them then the art of the soldier or of the musician certainli and so of all other thingsjustic is us when thei ar useless and useless when thei ar us that is the infer then justic is not good for much but let us consid thi further point is not he who can best strike a blow in a box match or in ani kind of fight best abl to ward off a blow certainli and he who is most skil in prevent or escap from a diseas is best abl to creat on true and he is the best guard of a camp who is best abl to steal a march upon the enemi certainli then he who is a good keeper of anyth is also a good thief that i suppos is to be infer then if the just man is good at keep monei he is good at steal it that is impli in the argument then after all the just man ha turn out to be a thief and thi is a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for he speak of autolycu the matern grandfath of odysseu who is a favourit of hi affirm that he wa excel abov all men in theft and perjuri and so you and homer and simonid ar agre that justic is an art of theft to be practis howev for the good of friend and for the harm of enemiesthat wa what you were sai no certainli not that though i do not now know what i did sai but i still stand by the latter word well there is anoth question by friend and enemi do we mean those who ar so realli or onli in seem sure he said a man mai be expect to love those whom he think good and to hate those whom he think evil ye but do not person often err about good and evil mani who ar not good seem to be so and convers that is true then to them the good will be enemi and the evil will be their friend true and in that case thei will be right in do good to the evil and evil to the good clearli but the good ar just and would not do an injustic true then accord to your argument it is just to injur those who do no wrong nai socrat the doctrin is immor then i suppos that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust i like that better but see the consequencemani a man who is ignor of human natur ha friend who ar bad friend and in that case he ought to do harm to them and he ha good enemi whom he ought to benefit but if so we shall be sai the veri opposit of that which we affirm to be the mean of simonid veri true he said and i think that we had better correct an error into which we seem to have fallen in the us of the word friend and enemi what wa the error polemarchu i ask we assum that he is a friend who seem to be or who is thought good and how is the error to be correct we should rather sai that he is a friend who is as well as seem good and that he who seem onli and is not good onli seem to be and is not a friend and of an enemi the same mai be said you would argu that the good ar our friend and the bad our enemi ye and instead of sai simpli as we did at first that it is just to do good to our friend and harm to our enemi we should further sai it is just to do good to our friend when thei ar good and harm to our enemi when thei ar evil ye that appear to me to be the truth but ought the just to injur ani on at all undoubtedli he ought to injur those who ar both wick and hi enemi when hors ar injur ar thei improv or deterior the latter deterior that is to sai in the good qualiti of hors not of dog ye of hors and dog ar deterior in the good qualiti of dog and not of hors of cours and will not men who ar injur be deterior in that which is the proper virtu of man certainli and that human virtu is justic to be sure then men who ar injur ar of necess made unjust that is the result but can the musician by hi art make men unmus certainli not or the horseman by hi art make them bad horsemen imposs and can the just by justic make men unjust or speak gener can the good by virtu make them bad assuredli not ani more than heat can produc cold it cannot or drought moistur clearli not nor can the good harm ani on imposs and the just is the good certainli then to injur a friend or ani on els is not the act of a just man but of the opposit who is the unjust i think that what you sai is quit true socrat then if a man sai that justic consist in the repay of debt and that good is the debt which a just man ow to hi friend and evil the debt which he ow to hi enemiesto sai thi is not wise for it is not true if as ha been clearli shown the injur of anoth can be in no case just i agre with you said polemarchu then you and i ar prepar to take up arm against ani on who attribut such a sai to simonid or bia or pittacu or ani other wise man or seer i am quit readi to do battl at your side he said shall i tell you whose i believ the sai to be whose i believ that periand or perdicca or xerx or ismenia the theban or some other rich and mighti man who had a great opinion of hi own power wa the first to sai that justic is do good to your friend and harm to your enemi most true he said ye i said but if thi definit of justic also break down what other can be offer sever time in the cours of the discuss thrasymachu had made an attempt to get the argument into hi own hand and had been put down by the rest of the compani who want to hear the end but when polemarchu and i had done speak and there wa a paus he could no longer hold hi peac and gather himself up he came at us like a wild beast seek to devour us we were quit panicstricken at the sight of him he roar out to the whole compani what folli socrat ha taken possess of you all and why sillybilli do you knock under to on anoth i sai that if you want realli to know what justic is you should not onli ask but answer and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refut of an oppon but have your own answer for there is mani a on who can ask and cannot answer and now i will not have you sai that justic is duti or advantag or profit or gain or interest for thi sort of nonsens will not do for me i must have clear and accuraci i wa panicstricken at hi word and could not look at him without trembl inde i believ that if i had not fix my ey upon him i should have been struck dumb but when i saw hi furi rise i look at him first and wa therefor abl to repli to him thrasymachu i said with a quiver dont be hard upon us polemarchu and i mai have been guilti of a littl mistak in the argument but i can assur you that the error wa not intent if we were seek for a piec of gold you would not imagin that we were knock under to on anoth and so lose our chanc of find it and why when we ar seek for justic a thing more preciou than mani piec of gold do you sai that we ar weakli yield to on anoth and not do our utmost to get at the truth nai my good friend we ar most will and anxiou to do so but the fact is that we cannot and if so you peopl who know all thing should piti us and not be angri with us how characterist of socrat he repli with a bitter laughthat your iron style did i not foreseehav i not alreadi told you that whatev he wa ask he would refus to answer and try ironi or ani other shuffl in order that he might avoid answer you ar a philosoph thrasymachu i repli and well know that if you ask a person what number make up twelv take care to prohibit him whom you ask from answer twice six or three time four or six time two or four time three for thi sort of nonsens will not do for methen obvious if that is your wai of put the question no on can answer you but suppos that he were to retort thrasymachu what do you mean if on of these number which you interdict be the true answer to the question am i fals to sai some other number which is not the right onei that your meaninghow would you answer him just as if the two case were at all alik he said why should thei not be i repli and even if thei ar not but onli appear to be so to the person who is ask ought he not to sai what he think whether you and i forbid him or not i presum then that you ar go to make on of the interdict answer i dare sai that i mai notwithstand the danger if upon reflect i approv of ani of them but what if i give you an answer about justic other and better he said than ani of these what do you deserv to have done to you done to mea becom the ignor i must learn from the wisethat is what i deserv to have done to me what and no payment a pleasant notion i will pai when i have the monei i repli but you have socrat said glaucon and you thrasymachu need be under no anxieti about monei for we will all make a contribut for socrat ye he repli and then socrat will do as he alwai doesrefus to answer himself but take and pull to piec the answer of some on els why my good friend i said how can ani on answer who know and sai that he know just noth and who even if he ha some faint notion of hi own is told by a man of author not to utter them the natur thing is that the speaker should be some on like yourself who profess to know and can tell what he know will you then kindli answer for the edif of the compani and of myself glaucon and the rest of the compani join in my request and thrasymachu as ani on might see wa in realiti eager to speak for he thought that he had an excel answer and would distinguish himself but at first he affect to insist on my answer at length he consent to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrat he refus to teach himself and goe about learn of other to whom he never even sai thank you that i learn of other i repli is quit true but that i am ungrat i wholli deni monei i have none and therefor i pai in prais which is all i have and how readi i am to prais ani on who appear to me to speak well you will veri soon find out when you answer for i expect that you will answer well listen then he said i proclaim that justic is noth els than the interest of the stronger and now why do you not prais me but of cours you wont let me first understand you i repli justic as you sai is the interest of the stronger what thrasymachu is the mean of thi you cannot mean to sai that becaus polydama the pancratiast is stronger than we ar and find the eat of beef conduc to hi bodili strength that to eat beef is therefor equal for our good who ar weaker than he is and right and just for us that abomin of you socrat you take the word in the sens which is most damag to the argument not at all my good sir i said i am try to understand them and i wish that you would be a littl clearer well he said have you never heard that form of govern differ there ar tyranni and there ar democraci and there ar aristocraci ye i know and the govern is the rule power in each state certainli and the differ form of govern make law democrat aristocrat tyrann with a view to their sever interest and these law which ar made by them for their own interest ar the justic which thei deliv to their subject and him who transgress them thei punish as a breaker of the law and unjust and that is what i mean when i sai that in all state there is the same principl of justic which is the interest of the govern and as the govern must be suppos to have power the onli reason conclus is that everywher there is on principl of justic which is the interest of the stronger now i understand you i said and whether you ar right or not i will try to discov but let me remark that in defin justic you have yourself us the word interest which you forbad me to us it is true howev that in your definit the word of the stronger ar ad a small addit you must allow he said great or small never mind about that we must first enquir whether what you ar sai is the truth now we ar both agre that justic is interest of some sort but you go on to sai of the stronger about thi addit i am not so sure and must therefor consid further proce i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just for subject to obei their ruler i do but ar the ruler of state absolut infal or ar thei sometim liabl to err to be sure he repli thei ar liabl to err then in make their law thei mai sometim make them rightli and sometim not true when thei make them rightli thei make them agreeabl to their interest when thei ar mistaken contrari to their interest you admit that ye and the law which thei make must be obei by their subjectsand that is what you call justic doubtless then justic accord to your argument is not onli obedi to the interest of the stronger but the revers what is that you ar sai he ask i am onli repeat what you ar sai i believ but let us consid have we not admit that the ruler mai be mistaken about their own interest in what thei command and also that to obei them is justic ha not that been admit ye then you must also have acknowledg justic not to be for the interest of the stronger when the ruler unintention command thing to be done which ar to their own injuri for if as you sai justic is the obedi which the subject render to their command in that case o wisest of men is there ani escap from the conclus that the weaker ar command to do not what is for the interest but what is for the injuri of the stronger noth can be clearer socrat said polemarchu ye said cleitophon interpos if you ar allow to be hi wit but there is no need of ani wit said polemarchu for thrasymachu himself acknowledg that ruler mai sometim command what is not for their own interest and that for subject to obei them is justic ye polemarchusthrasymachu said that for subject to do what wa command by their ruler is just ye cleitophon but he also said that justic is the interest of the stronger and while admit both these proposit he further acknowledg that the stronger mai command the weaker who ar hi subject to do what is not for hi own interest whenc follow that justic is the injuri quit as much as the interest of the stronger but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the stronger thought to be hi interestthi wa what the weaker had to do and thi wa affirm by him to be justic those were not hi word rejoin polemarchu never mind i repli if he now sai that thei ar let us accept hi statement tell me thrasymachu i said did you mean by justic what the stronger thought to be hi interest whether realli so or not certainli not he said do you suppos that i call him who is mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken ye i said my impress wa that you did so when you admit that the ruler wa not infal but might be sometim mistaken you argu like an inform socrat do you mean for exampl that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken or that he who err in arithmet or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the time when he is make the mistak in respect of the mistak true we sai that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian ha made a mistak but thi is onli a wai of speak for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor ani other person of skill ever make a mistak in so far as he is what hi name impli thei none of them err unless their skill fail them and then thei ceas to be skill artist no artist or sage or ruler err at the time when he is what hi name impli though he is commonli said to err and i adopt the common mode of speak but to be perfectli accur sinc you ar such a lover of accuraci we should sai that the ruler in so far as he is a ruler is uner and be uner alwai command that which is for hi own interest and the subject is requir to execut hi command and therefor as i said at first and now repeat justic is the interest of the stronger inde thrasymachu and do i realli appear to you to argu like an inform certainli he repli and do you suppos that i ask these question with ani design of injur you in the argument nai he repli suppos is not the wordi know it but you will be found out and by sheer forc of argument you will never prevail i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid ani misunderstand occur between us in futur let me ask in what sens do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as you were sai he be the superior it is just that the inferior should executei he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sens of the term in the strictest of all sens he said and now cheat and plai the inform if you can i ask no quarter at your hand but you never will be abl never and do you imagin i said that i am such a madman as to try and cheat thrasymachu i might as well shave a lion why he said you made the attempt a minut ago and you fail enough i said of these civil it will be better that i should ask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sens of which you ar speak a healer of the sick or a maker of monei and rememb that i am now speak of the true physician a healer of the sick he repli and the pilotthat is to sai the true piloti he a captain of sailor or a mere sailor a captain of sailor the circumst that he sail in the ship is not to be taken into account neither is he to be call a sailor the name pilot by which he is distinguish ha noth to do with sail but is signific of hi skill and of hi author over the sailor veri true he said now i said everi art ha an interest certainli for which the art ha to consid and provid ye that is the aim of art and the interest of ani art is the perfect of itthi and noth els what do you mean i mean what i mai illustr neg by the exampl of the bodi suppos you were to ask me whether the bodi is selfsuff or ha want i should repli certainli the bodi ha want for the bodi mai be ill and requir to be cure and ha therefor interest to which the art of medicin minist and thi is the origin and intent of medicin as you will acknowledg am i not right quit right he repli but is the art of medicin or ani other art faulti or defici in ani qualiti in the same wai that the ey mai be defici in sight or the ear fail of hear and therefor requir anoth art to provid for the interest of see and hearingha art in itself i sai ani similar liabil to fault or defect and doe everi art requir anoth supplementari art to provid for it interest and that anoth and anoth without end or have the art to look onli after their own interest or have thei no need either of themselv or of anotherhav no fault or defect thei have no need to correct them either by the exercis of their own art or of ani other thei have onli to consid the interest of their subjectmatt for everi art remain pure and faultless while remain truethat is to sai while perfect and unimpair take the word in your precis sens and tell me whether i am not right ye clearli then medicin doe not consid the interest of medicin but the interest of the bodi true he said nor doe the art of horsemanship consid the interest of the art of horsemanship but the interest of the hors neither do ani other art care for themselv for thei have no need thei care onli for that which is the subject of their art true he said but sure thrasymachu the art ar the superior and ruler of their own subject to thi he assent with a good deal of reluct then i said no scienc or art consid or enjoin the interest of the stronger or superior but onli the interest of the subject and weaker he made an attempt to contest thi proposit also but final acquiesc then i continu no physician in so far as he is a physician consid hi own good in what he prescrib but the good of hi patient for the true physician is also a ruler have the human bodi as a subject and is not a mere moneymak that ha been admit ye and the pilot likewis in the strict sens of the term is a ruler of sailor and not a mere sailor that ha been admit and such a pilot and ruler will provid and prescrib for the interest of the sailor who is under him and not for hi own or the ruler interest he gave a reluct ye then i said thrasymachu there is no on in ani rule who in so far as he is a ruler consid or enjoin what is for hi own interest but alwai what is for the interest of hi subject or suitabl to hi art to that he look and that alon he consid in everyth which he sai and doe when we had got to thi point in the argument and everi on saw that the definit of justic had been complet upset thrasymachu instead of repli to me said tell me socrat have you got a nurs why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather to be answer becaus she leav you to snivel and never wipe your nose she ha not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep what make you sai that i repli becaus you fanci that the shepherd or neatherd fatten or tend the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or hi master and you further imagin that the ruler of state if thei ar true ruler never think of their subject as sheep and that thei ar not studi their own advantag dai and night oh no and so entir astrai ar you in your idea about the just and unjust as not even to know that justic and the just ar in realiti anoth good that is to sai the interest of the ruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant and injustic the opposit for the unjust is lord over the truli simpl and just he is the stronger and hi subject do what is for hi interest and minist to hi happi which is veri far from be their own consid further most foolish socrat that the just is alwai a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all in privat contract wherev the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that when the partnership is dissolv the unjust man ha alwai more and the just less secondli in their deal with the state when there is an incometax the just man will pai more and the unjust less on the same amount of incom and when there is anyth to be receiv the on gain noth and the other much observ also what happen when thei take an offic there is the just man neglect hi affair and perhap suffer other loss and get noth out of the public becaus he is just moreov he is hate by hi friend and acquaint for refus to serv them in unlaw wai but all thi is revers in the case of the unjust man i am speak as befor of injustic on a larg scale in which the advantag of the unjust is most appar and my mean will be most clearli seen if we turn to that highest form of injustic in which the crimin is the happiest of men and the suffer or those who refus to do injustic ar the most miserablethat is to sai tyranni which by fraud and forc take awai the properti of other not littl by littl but wholesal comprehend in on thing sacr as well as profan privat and public for which act of wrong if he were detect perpetr ani on of them singli he would be punish and incur great disgracethei who do such wrong in particular case ar call robber of templ and mansteal and burglar and swindler and thiev but when a man besid take awai the monei of the citizen ha made slave of them then instead of these name of reproach he is term happi and bless not onli by the citizen but by all who hear of hi have achiev the consumm of injustic for mankind censur injustic fear that thei mai be the victim of it and not becaus thei shrink from commit it and thu as i have shown socrat injustic when on a suffici scale ha more strength and freedom and masteri than justic and as i said at first justic is the interest of the stronger wherea injustic is a man own profit and interest thrasymachu when he had thu spoken have like a bathman delug our ear with hi word had a mind to go awai but the compani would not let him thei insist that he should remain and defend hi posit and i myself ad my own humbl request that he would not leav us thrasymachu i said to him excel man how suggest ar your remark and ar you go to run awai befor you have fairli taught or learn whether thei ar true or not is the attempt to determin the wai of man life so small a matter in your eyesto determin how life mai be pass by each on of us to the greatest advantag and do i differ from you he said as to the import of the enquiri you appear rather i repli to have no care or thought about us thrasymachuswheth we live better or wors from not know what you sai you know is to you a matter of indiffer prithe friend do not keep your knowledg to yourself we ar a larg parti and ani benefit which you confer upon us will be ampli reward for my own part i openli declar that i am not convinc and that i do not believ injustic to be more gain than justic even if uncontrol and allow to have free plai for grant that there mai be an unjust man who is abl to commit injustic either by fraud or forc still thi doe not convinc me of the superior advantag of injustic and there mai be other who ar in the same predica with myself perhap we mai be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convinc us that we ar mistaken in prefer justic to injustic and how am i to convinc you he said if you ar not alreadi convinc by what i have just said what more can i do for you would you have me put the proof bodili into your soul heaven forbid i said i would onli ask you to be consist or if you chang chang openli and let there be no decept for i must remark thrasymachu if you will recal what wa previous said that although you began by defin the true physician in an exact sens you did not observ a like exact when speak of the shepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tend the sheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner or banquett with a view to the pleasur of the tabl or again as a trader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet sure the art of the shepherd is concern onli with the good of hi subject he ha onli to provid the best for them sinc the perfect of the art is alreadi ensur whenev all the requir of it ar satisfi and that wa what i wa sai just now about the ruler i conceiv that the art of the ruler consid as ruler whether in a state or in privat life could onli regard the good of hi flock or subject wherea you seem to think that the ruler in state that is to sai the true ruler like be in author think nai i am sure of it then why in the case of lesser offic do men never take them willingli without payment unless under the idea that thei govern for the advantag not of themselv but of other let me ask you a question ar not the sever art differ by reason of their each have a separ function and my dear illustri friend do sai what you think that we mai make a littl progress ye that is the differ he repli and each art give us a particular good and not mere a gener onemedicin for exampl give us health navig safeti at sea and so on ye he said and the art of payment ha the special function of give pai but we do not confus thi with other art ani more than the art of the pilot is to be confus with the art of medicin becaus the health of the pilot mai be improv by a sea voyag you would not be inclin to sai would you that navig is the art of medicin at least if we ar to adopt your exact us of languag certainli not or becaus a man is in good health when he receiv pai you would not sai that the art of payment is medicin i should not nor would you sai that medicin is the art of receiv pai becaus a man take fee when he is engag in heal certainli not and we have admit i said that the good of each art is special confin to the art ye then if there be ani good which all artist have in common that is to be attribut to someth of which thei all have the common us true he repli and when the artist is benefit by receiv pai the advantag is gain by an addit us of the art of pai which is not the art profess by him he gave a reluct assent to thi then the pai is not deriv by the sever artist from their respect art but the truth is that while the art of medicin give health and the art of the builder build a hous anoth art attend them which is the art of pai the variou art mai be do their own busi and benefit that over which thei presid but would the artist receiv ani benefit from hi art unless he were paid as well i suppos not but doe he therefor confer no benefit when he work for noth certainli he confer a benefit then now thrasymachu there is no longer ani doubt that neither art nor govern provid for their own interest but as we were befor sai thei rule and provid for the interest of their subject who ar the weaker and not the strongerto their good thei attend and not to the good of the superior and thi is the reason my dear thrasymachu why as i wa just now sai no on is will to govern becaus no on like to take in hand the reform of evil which ar not hi concern without remuner for in the execut of hi work and in give hi order to anoth the true artist doe not regard hi own interest but alwai that of hi subject and therefor in order that ruler mai be will to rule thei must be paid in on of three mode of payment monei or honour or a penalti for refus what do you mean socrat said glaucon the first two mode of payment ar intellig enough but what the penalti is i do not understand or how a penalti can be a payment you mean that you do not understand the natur of thi payment which to the best men is the great induc to rule of cours you know that ambit and avaric ar held to be as inde thei ar a disgrac veri true and for thi reason i said monei and honour have no attract for them good men do not wish to be openli demand payment for govern and so to get the name of hirel nor by secretli help themselv out of the public revenu to get the name of thiev and not be ambiti thei do not care about honour wherefor necess must be laid upon them and thei must be induc to serv from the fear of punish and thi as i imagin is the reason why the forward to take offic instead of wait to be compel ha been deem dishonour now the worst part of the punish is that he who refus to rule is liabl to be rule by on who is wors than himself and the fear of thi as i conceiv induc the good to take offic not becaus thei would but becaus thei cannot helpnot under the idea that thei ar go to have ani benefit or enjoy themselv but as a necess and becaus thei ar not abl to commit the task of rule to ani on who is better than themselv or inde as good for there is reason to think that if a citi were compos entir of good men then to avoid offic would be as much an object of content as to obtain offic is at present then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by natur to regard hi own interest but that of hi subject and everi on who knew thi would choos rather to receiv a benefit from anoth than to have the troubl of confer on so far am i from agre with thrasymachu that justic is the interest of the stronger thi latter question need not be further discuss at present but when thrasymachu sai that the life of the unjust is more advantag than that of the just hi new statement appear to me to be of a far more seriou charact which of us ha spoken truli and which sort of life glaucon do you prefer i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantag he answer did you hear all the advantag of the unjust which thrasymachu wa rehears ye i heard him he repli but he ha not convinc me then shall we try to find some wai of convinc him if we can that he is sai what is not true most certainli he repli if i said he make a set speech and we make anoth recount all the advantag of be just and he answer and we rejoin there must be a number and measur of the good which ar claim on either side and in the end we shall want judg to decid but if we proce in our enquiri as we late did by make admiss to on anoth we shall unit the offic of judg and advoc in our own person veri good he said and which method do i understand you to prefer i said that which you propos well then thrasymachu i said suppos you begin at the begin and answer me you sai that perfect injustic is more gain than perfect justic ye that is what i sai and i have given you my reason and what is your view about them would you call on of them virtu and the other vice certainli i suppos that you would call justic virtu and injustic vice what a charm notion so like too see that i affirm injustic to be profit and justic not what els then would you sai the opposit he repli and would you call justic vice no i would rather sai sublim simplic then would you call injustic malign no i would rather sai discret and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good ye he said at ani rate those of them who ar abl to be perfectli unjust and who have the power of subdu state and nation but perhap you imagin me to be talk of cutpurs even thi profess if undetect ha advantag though thei ar not to be compar with those of which i wa just now speak i do not think that i misapprehend your mean thrasymachu i repli but still i cannot hear without amaz that you class injustic with wisdom and virtu and justic with the opposit certainli i do so class them now i said you ar on more substanti and almost unanswer ground for if the injustic which you were maintain to be profit had been admit by you as by other to be vice and deform an answer might have been given to you on receiv principl but now i perceiv that you will call injustic honour and strong and to the unjust you will attribut all the qualiti which were attribut by us befor to the just see that you do not hesit to rank injustic with wisdom and virtu you have guess most infal he repli then i certainli ought not to shrink from go through with the argument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachu ar speak your real mind for i do believ that you ar now in earnest and ar not amus yourself at our expens i mai be in earnest or not but what is that to youto refut the argument is your busi veri true i said that is what i have to do but will you be so good as answer yet on more question doe the just man try to gain ani advantag over the just far otherwis if he did he would not be the simpl amus creatur which he is and would he try to go beyond just action he would not and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantag over the unjust would that be consid by him as just or unjust he would think it just and would try to gain the advantag but he would not be abl whether he would or would not be abl i said is not to the point my question is onli whether the just man while refus to have more than anoth just man would wish and claim to have more than the unjust ye he would and what of the unjustdo he claim to have more than the just man and to do more than is just of cours he said for he claim to have more than all men and the unjust man will strive and struggl to obtain more than the unjust man or action in order that he mai have more than all true we mai put the matter thu i saidth just doe not desir more than hi like but more than hi unlik wherea the unjust desir more than both hi like and hi unlik noth he said can be better than that statement and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither good again he said and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlik them of cours he said he who is of a certain natur is like those who ar of a certain natur he who is not not each of them i said is such as hi like is certainli he repli veri good thrasymachu i said and now to take the case of the art you would admit that on man is a musician and anoth not a musician ye and which is wise and which is foolish clearli the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he is foolish ye and you would sai the same sort of thing of the physician ye and do you think my excel friend that a musician when he adjust the lyre would desir or claim to exce or go beyond a musician in the tighten and loosen the string i do not think that he would but he would claim to exce the nonmusician of cours and what would you sai of the physician in prescrib meat and drink would he wish to go beyond anoth physician or beyond the practic of medicin he would not but he would wish to go beyond the nonphysician ye and about knowledg and ignor in gener see whether you think that ani man who ha knowledg ever would wish to have the choic of sai or do more than anoth man who ha knowledg would he not rather sai or do the same as hi like in the same case that i suppos can hardli be deni and what of the ignor would he not desir to have more than either the know or the ignor i dare sai and the know is wise ye and the wise is good true then the wise and good will not desir to gain more than hi like but more than hi unlik and opposit i suppos so wherea the bad and ignor will desir to gain more than both ye but did we not sai thrasymachu that the unjust goe beyond both hi like and unlik were not these your word thei were and you also said that the just will not go beyond hi like but hi unlik ye then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil and ignor that is the infer and each of them is such as hi like is that wa admit then the just ha turn out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and ignor thrasymachu made all these admiss not fluentli as i repeat them but with extrem reluct it wa a hot summer dai and the perspir pour from him in torrent and then i saw what i had never seen befor thrasymachu blush as we were now agre that justic wa virtu and wisdom and injustic vice and ignor i proceed to anoth point well i said thrasymachu that matter is now settl but were we not also sai that injustic had strength do you rememb ye i rememb he said but do not suppos that i approv of what you ar sai or have no answer if howev i were to answer you would be quit certain to accus me of harangu therefor either permit me to have my sai out or if you would rather ask do so and i will answer veri good as thei sai to storytel old women and will nod ye and no certainli not i said if contrari to your real opinion ye he said i will to pleas you sinc you will not let me speak what els would you have noth in the world i said and if you ar so dispos i will ask and you shall answer proce then i will repeat the question which i ask befor in order that our examin of the rel natur of justic and injustic mai be carri on regularli a statement wa made that injustic is stronger and more power than justic but now justic have been identifi with wisdom and virtu is easili shown to be stronger than injustic if injustic is ignor thi can no longer be question by ani on but i want to view the matter thrasymachu in a differ wai you would not deni that a state mai be unjust and mai be unjustli attempt to enslav other state or mai have alreadi enslav them and mai be hold mani of them in subject true he repli and i will add that the best and most perfectli unjust state will be most like to do so i know i said that such wa your posit but what i would further consid is whether thi power which is possess by the superior state can exist or be exercis without justic or onli with justic if you ar right in your view and justic is wisdom then onli with justic but if i am right then without justic i am delight thrasymachu to see you not onli nod assent and dissent but make answer which ar quit excel that is out of civil to you he repli you ar veri kind i said and would you have the good also to inform me whether you think that a state or an armi or a band of robber and thiev or ani other gang of evildo could act at all if thei injur on anoth no inde he said thei could not but if thei abstain from injur on anoth then thei might act togeth better ye and thi is becaus injustic creat divis and hatr and fight and justic impart harmoni and friendship is not that true thrasymachu i agre he said becaus i do not wish to quarrel with you how good of you i said but i should like to know also whether injustic have thi tendenc to arous hatr wherev exist among slave or among freemen will not make them hate on anoth and set them at varianc and render them incap of common action certainli and even if injustic be found in two onli will thei not quarrel and fight and becom enemi to on anoth and to the just thei will and suppos injustic abid in a singl person would your wisdom sai that she lose or that she retain her natur power let us assum that she retain her power yet is not the power which injustic exercis of such a natur that wherev she take up her abod whether in a citi in an armi in a famili or in ani other bodi that bodi is to begin with render incap of unit action by reason of sedit and distract and doe it not becom it own enemi and at varianc with all that oppos it and with the just is not thi the case ye certainli and is not injustic equal fatal when exist in a singl person in the first place render him incap of action becaus he is not at uniti with himself and in the second place make him an enemi to himself and the just is not that true thrasymachu ye and o my friend i said sure the god ar just grant that thei ar but if so the unjust will be the enemi of the god and the just will be their friend feast awai in triumph and take your fill of the argument i will not oppos you lest i should displeas the compani well then proce with your answer and let me have the remaind of my repast for we have alreadi shown that the just ar clearli wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that the unjust ar incap of common action nai more that to speak as we did of men who ar evil act at ani time vigor togeth is not strictli true for if thei had been perfectli evil thei would have laid hand upon on anoth but it is evid that there must have been some remnant of justic in them which enabl them to combin if there had not been thei would have injur on anoth as well as their victim thei were but halfvillain in their enterpris for had thei been whole villain and utterli unjust thei would have been utterli incap of action that as i believ is the truth of the matter and not what you said at first but whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also propos to consid i think that thei have and for the reason which i have given but still i should like to examin further for no light matter is at stake noth less than the rule of human life proce i will proce by ask a question would you not sai that a hors ha some end i should and the end or us of a hors or of anyth would be that which could not be accomplish or not so well accomplish by ani other thing i do not understand he said let me explain can you see except with the ey certainli not or hear except with the ear no these then mai be truli said to be the end of these organ thei mai but you can cut off a vinebranch with a dagger or with a chisel and in mani other wai of cours and yet not so well as with a pruninghook made for the purpos true mai we not sai that thi is the end of a pruninghook we mai then now i think you will have no difficulti in understand my mean when i ask the question whether the end of anyth would be that which could not be accomplish or not so well accomplish by ani other thing i understand your mean he said and assent and that to which an end is appoint ha also an excel need i ask again whether the ey ha an end it ha and ha not the ey an excel ye and the ear ha an end and an excel also true and the same is true of all other thing thei have each of them an end and a special excel that is so well and can the ey fulfil their end if thei ar want in their own proper excel and have a defect instead how can thei he said if thei ar blind and cannot see you mean to sai if thei have lost their proper excel which is sight but i have not arriv at that point yet i would rather ask the question more gener and onli enquir whether the thing which fulfil their end fulfil them by their own proper excel and fail of fulfil them by their own defect certainli he repli i might sai the same of the ear when depriv of their own proper excel thei cannot fulfil their end true and the same observ will appli to all other thing i agre well and ha not the soul an end which noth els can fulfil for exampl to superintend and command and deliber and the like ar not these function proper to the soul and can thei rightli be assign to ani other to no other and is not life to be reckon among the end of the soul assuredli he said and ha not the soul an excel also ye and can she or can she not fulfil her own end when depriv of that excel she cannot then an evil soul must necessarili be an evil ruler and superintend and the good soul a good ruler ye necessarili and we have admit that justic is the excel of the soul and injustic the defect of the soul that ha been admit then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust man will live ill that is what your argument prove and he who live well is bless and happi and he who live ill the revers of happi certainli then the just is happi and the unjust miser so be it but happi and not miseri is profit of cours then my bless thrasymachu injustic can never be more profit than justic let thi socrat he said be your entertain at the bendidea for which i am indebt to you i said now that you have grown gentl toward me and have left off scold nevertheless i have not been well entertain but that wa my own fault and not your as an epicur snatch a tast of everi dish which is success brought to tabl he not have allow himself time to enjoi the on befor so have i gone from on subject to anoth without have discov what i sought at first the natur of justic i left that enquiri and turn awai to consid whether justic is virtu and wisdom or evil and folli and when there aros a further question about the compar advantag of justic and injustic i could not refrain from pass on to that and the result of the whole discuss ha been that i know noth at all for i know not what justic is and therefor i am not like to know whether it is or is not a virtu nor can i sai whether the just man is happi or unhappi book ii with these word i wa think that i had made an end of the discuss but the end in truth prove to be onli a begin for glaucon who is alwai the most pugnaci of men wa dissatisfi at thrasymachu retir he want to have the battl out so he said to me socrat do you wish realli to persuad us or onli to seem to have persuad us that to be just is alwai better than to be unjust i should wish realli to persuad you i repli if i could then you certainli have not succeed let me ask you nowhow would you arrang goodsar there not some which we welcom for their own sake and independ of their consequ as for exampl harmless pleasur and enjoy which delight us at the time although noth follow from them i agre in think that there is such a class i repli is there not also a second class of good such as knowledg sight health which ar desir not onli in themselv but also for their result certainli i said and would you not recogn a third class such as gymnast and the care of the sick and the physician art also the variou wai of moneymakingthes do us good but we regard them as disagre and no on would choos them for their own sake but onli for the sake of some reward or result which flow from them there is i said thi third class also but why do you ask becaus i want to know in which of the three class you would place justic in the highest class i repliedamong those good which he who would be happi desir both for their own sake and for the sake of their result then the mani ar of anoth mind thei think that justic is to be reckon in the troublesom class among good which ar to be pursu for the sake of reward and of reput but in themselv ar disagre and rather to be avoid i know i said that thi is their manner of think and that thi wa the thesi which thrasymachu wa maintain just now when he censur justic and prais injustic but i am too stupid to be convinc by him i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agre for thrasymachu seem to me like a snake to have been charm by your voic sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the natur of justic and injustic have not yet been made clear set asid their reward and result i want to know what thei ar in themselv and how thei inwardli work in the soul if you pleas then i will reviv the argument of thrasymachu and first i will speak of the natur and origin of justic accord to the common view of them secondli i will show that all men who practis justic do so against their will of necess but not as a good and thirdli i will argu that there is reason in thi view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the justif what thei sai is true socrat sinc i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledg that i am perplex when i hear the voic of thrasymachu and myriad of other din in my ear and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superior of justic to injustic maintain by ani on in a satisfactori wai i want to hear justic prais in respect of itself then i shall be satisfi and you ar the person from whom i think that i am most like to hear thi and therefor i will prais the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speak will indic the manner in which i desir to hear you too prais justic and censur injustic will you sai whether you approv of my propos inde i do nor can i imagin ani theme about which a man of sens would often wish to convers i am delight he repli to hear you sai so and shall begin by speak as i propos of the natur and origin of justic thei sai that to do injustic is by natur good to suffer injustic evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffer injustic and have had experi of both not be abl to avoid the on and obtain the other thei think that thei had better agre among themselv to have neither henc there aris law and mutual coven and that which is ordain by law is term by them law and just thi thei affirm to be the origin and natur of justiceit is a mean or compromis between the best of all which is to do injustic and not be punish and the worst of all which is to suffer injustic without the power of retali and justic be at a middl point between the two is toler not as a good but as the lesser evil and honour by reason of the inabl of men to do injustic for no man who is worthi to be call a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were abl to resist he would be mad if he did such is the receiv account socrat of the natur and origin of justic now that those who practis justic do so involuntarili and becaus thei have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagin someth of thi kind have given both to the just and the unjust power to do what thei will let us watch and see whither desir will lead them then we shall discov in the veri act the just and unjust man to be proceed along the same road follow their interest which all natur deem to be their good and ar onli divert into the path of justic by the forc of law the liberti which we ar suppos mai be most complet given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possess by gyge the ancestor of croesu the lydian accord to the tradit gyge wa a shepherd in the servic of the king of lydia there wa a great storm and an earthquak made an open in the earth at the place where he wa feed hi flock amaz at the sight he descend into the open where among other marvel he beheld a hollow brazen hors have door at which he stoop and look in saw a dead bodi of statur as appear to him more than human and have noth on but a gold ring thi he took from the finger of the dead and reascend now the shepherd met togeth accord to custom that thei might send their monthli report about the flock to the king into their assembl he came have the ring on hi finger and as he wa sit among them he chanc to turn the collet of the ring insid hi hand when instantli he becam invis to the rest of the compani and thei began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he wa astonish at thi and again touch the ring he turn the collet outward and reappear he made sever trial of the ring and alwai with the same resultwhen he turn the collet inward he becam invis when outward he reappear whereupon he contriv to be chosen on of the messeng who were sent to the court wherea soon as he arriv he seduc the queen and with her help conspir against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppos now that there were two such magic ring and the just put on on of them and the unjust the other no man can be imagin to be of such an iron natur that he would stand fast in justic no man would keep hi hand off what wa not hi own when he could safe take what he like out of the market or go into hous and lie with ani on at hi pleasur or kill or releas from prison whom he would and in all respect be like a god among men then the action of the just would be as the action of the unjust thei would both come at last to the same point and thi we mai truli affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingli or becaus he think that justic is ani good to him individu but of necess for wherev ani on think that he can safe be unjust there he is unjust for all men believ in their heart that injustic is far more profit to the individu than justic and he who argu as i have been suppos will sai that thei ar right if you could imagin ani on obtain thi power of becom invis and never do ani wrong or touch what wa anoth he would be thought by the lookerson to be a most wretch idiot although thei would prais him to on anoth face and keep up appear with on anoth from a fear that thei too might suffer injustic enough of thi now if we ar to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isol them there is no other wai and how is the isol to be effect i answer let the unjust man be entir unjust and the just man entir just noth is to be taken awai from either of them and both ar to be perfectli furnish for the work of their respect live first let the unjust be like other distinguish master of craft like the skil pilot or physician who know intuit hi own power and keep within their limit and who if he fail at ani point is abl to recov himself so let the unjust make hi unjust attempt in the right wai and lie hidden if he mean to be great in hi injustic he who is found out is nobodi for the highest reach of injustic is to be deem just when you ar not therefor i sai that in the perfectli unjust man we must assum the most perfect injustic there is to be no deduct but we must allow him while do the most unjust act to have acquir the greatest reput for justic if he have taken a fals step he must be abl to recov himself he must be on who can speak with effect if ani of hi deed come to light and who can forc hi wai where forc is requir by hi courag and strength and command of monei and friend and at hi side let us place the just man in hi nobl and simplic wish as aeschylu sai to be and not to seem good there must be no seem for if he seem to be just he will be honour and reward and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justic or for the sake of honour and reward therefor let him be cloth in justic onli and have no other cover and he must be imagin in a state of life the opposit of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affect by the fear of infami and it consequ and let him continu thu to the hour of death be just and seem to be unjust when both have reach the uttermost extrem the on of justic and the other of injustic let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two heaven my dear glaucon i said how energet you polish them up for the decis first on and then the other as if thei were two statu i do my best he said and now that we know what thei ar like there is no difficulti in trace out the sort of life which await either of them thi i will proce to describ but as you mai think the descript a littl too coars i ask you to suppos socrat that the word which follow ar not minelet me put them into the mouth of the eulogist of injustic thei will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourg rack boundwil have hi ey burnt out and at last after suffer everi kind of evil he will be impal then he will understand that he ought to seem onli and not to be just the word of aeschylu mai be more truli spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursu a realiti he doe not live with a view to appearancesh want to be realli unjust and not to seem onli hi mind ha a soil deep and fertil out of which spring hi prudent counsel in the first place he is thought just and therefor bear rule in the citi he can marri whom he will and give in marriag to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he like and alwai to hi own advantag becaus he ha no misgiv about injustic and at everi contest whether in public or privat he get the better of hi antagonist and gain at their expens and is rich and out of hi gain he can benefit hi friend and harm hi enemi moreov he can offer sacrific and dedic gift to the god abundantli and magnific and can honour the god or ani man whom he want to honour in a far better style than the just and therefor he is like to be dearer than thei ar to the god and thu socrat god and men ar said to unit in make the life of the unjust better than the life of the just i wa go to sai someth in answer to glaucon when adeimantu hi brother interpos socrat he said you do not suppos that there is noth more to be urg why what els is there i answer the strongest point of all ha not been even mention he repli well then accord to the proverb let brother help brotherif he fail in ani part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon ha alreadi said quit enough to lai me in the dust and take from me the power of help justic nonsens he repli but let me add someth more there is anoth side to glaucon argument about the prais and censur of justic and injustic which is equal requir in order to bring out what i believ to be hi mean parent and tutor ar alwai tell their son and their ward that thei ar to be just but why not for the sake of justic but for the sake of charact and reput in the hope of obtain for him who is reput just some of those offic marriag and the like which glaucon ha enumer among the advantag accru to the unjust from the reput of justic more howev is made of appear by thi class of person than by the other for thei throw in the good opinion of the god and will tell you of a shower of benefit which the heaven as thei sai rain upon the piou and thi accord with the testimoni of the nobl hesiod and homer the first of whom sai that the god make the oak of the just to bear acorn at their summit and bee in the middl and the sheep ar bow down with the weight of their fleec and mani other bless of a like kind ar provid for them and homer ha a veri similar strain for he speak of on whose fame is as the fame of some blameless king who like a god maintain justic to whom the black earth bring forth wheat and barlei whose tree ar bow with fruit and hi sheep never fail to bear and the sea give him fish still grander ar the gift of heaven which musaeu and hi son vouchsaf to the just thei take them down into the world below where thei have the saint ly on couch at a feast everlastingli drunk crown with garland their idea seem to be that an immort of drunken is the highest meed of virtu some extend their reward yet further the poster as thei sai of the faith and just shall surviv to the third and fourth gener thi is the style in which thei prais justic but about the wick there is anoth strain thei buri them in a slough in hade and make them carri water in a siev also while thei ar yet live thei bring them to infami and inflict upon them the punish which glaucon describ as the portion of the just who ar reput to be unjust noth els doe their invent suppli such is their manner of prais the on and censur the other onc more socrat i will ask you to consid anoth wai of speak about justic and injustic which is not confin to the poet but is found in prose writer the univers voic of mankind is alwai declar that justic and virtu ar honour but grievou and toilsom and that the pleasur of vice and injustic ar easi of attain and ar onli censur by law and opinion thei sai also that honesti is for the most part less profit than dishonesti and thei ar quit readi to call wick men happi and to honour them both in public and privat when thei ar rich or in ani other wai influenti while thei despis and overlook those who mai be weak and poor even though acknowledg them to be better than the other but most extraordinari of all is their mode of speak about virtu and the god thei sai that the god apport calam and miseri to mani good men and good and happi to the wick and mendic prophet go to rich men door and persuad them that thei have a power commit to them by the god of make an aton for a man own or hi ancestor sin by sacrific or charm with rejoic and feast and thei promis to harm an enemi whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic art and incant bind heaven as thei sai to execut their will and the poet ar the author to whom thei appeal now smooth the path of vice with the word of hesiod vice mai be had in abund without troubl the wai is smooth and her dwellingplac is near but befor virtu the god have set toil and a tediou and uphil road then cite homer as a wit that the god mai be influenc by men for he also sai the god too mai be turn from their purpos and men prai to them and avert their wrath by sacrific and sooth entreati and by libat and the odour of fat when thei have sin and transgress and thei produc a host of book written by musaeu and orpheu who were children of the moon and the musesthat is what thei sayaccord to which thei perform their ritual and persuad not onli individu but whole citi that expiat and aton for sin mai be made by sacrific and amus which fill a vacant hour and ar equal at the servic of the live and the dead the latter sort thei call mysteri and thei redeem us from the pain of hell but if we neglect them no on know what await us he proceed and now when the young hear all thi said about virtu and vice and the wai in which god and men regard them how ar their mind like to be affect my dear socratesthos of them i mean who ar quickwit and like bee on the wing light on everi flower and from all that thei hear ar prone to draw conclus as to what manner of person thei should be and in what wai thei should walk if thei would make the best of life probabl the youth will sai to himself in the word of pindar can i by justic or by crook wai of deceit ascend a loftier tower which mai be a fortress to me all my dai for what men sai is that if i am realli just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand ar unmistak but if though unjust i acquir the reput of justic a heavenli life is promis to me sinc then as philosoph prove appear tyrann over truth and is lord of happi to appear i must devot myself i will describ around me a pictur and shadow of virtu to be the vestibul and exterior of my hous behind i will trail the subtl and crafti fox as archilochu greatest of sage recommend but i hear some on exclaim that the conceal of wicked is often difficult to which i answer noth great is easi nevertheless the argument indic thi if we would be happi to be the path along which we should proce with a view to conceal we will establish secret brotherhood and polit club and there ar professor of rhetor who teach the art of persuad court and assembl and so partli by persuas and partli by forc i shall make unlaw gain and not be punish still i hear a voic sai that the god cannot be deceiv neither can thei be compel but what if there ar no god or suppos them to have no care of human thingswhi in either case should we mind about conceal and even if there ar god and thei do care about us yet we know of them onli from tradit and the genealog of the poet and these ar the veri person who sai that thei mai be influenc and turn by sacrific and sooth entreati and by offer let us be consist then and believ both or neither if the poet speak truli why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruit of injustic for if we ar just although we mai escap the vengeanc of heaven we shall lose the gain of injustic but if we ar unjust we shall keep the gain and by our sin and prai and prai and sin the god will be propiti and we shall not be punish but there is a world below in which either we or our poster will suffer for our unjust deed ye my friend will be the reflect but there ar mysteri and aton deiti and these have great power that is what mighti citi declar and the children of the god who were their poet and prophet bear a like testimoni on what principl then shall we ani longer choos justic rather than the worst injustic when if we onli unit the latter with a deceit regard to appear we shall fare to our mind both with god and men in life and after death as the most numer and the highest author tell us know all thi socrat how can a man who ha ani superior of mind or person or rank or wealth be will to honour justic or inde to refrain from laugh when he hear justic prais and even if there should be some on who is abl to disprov the truth of my word and who is satisfi that justic is best still he is not angri with the unjust but is veri readi to forgiv them becaus he also know that men ar not just of their own free will unless peradventur there be some on whom the divin within him mai have inspir with a hatr of injustic or who ha attain knowledg of the truthbut no other man he onli blame injustic who ow to cowardic or ag or some weak ha not the power of be unjust and thi is prove by the fact that when he obtain the power he immedi becom unjust as far as he can be the caus of all thi socrat wa indic by us at the begin of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonish we were to find that of all the profess panegyrist of justicebegin with the ancient hero of whom ani memori ha been preserv to us and end with the men of our own timeno on ha ever blame injustic or prais justic except with a view to the glori honour and benefit which flow from them no on ha ever adequ describ either in vers or prose the true essenti natur of either of them abid in the soul and invis to ani human or divin ey or shown that of all the thing of a man soul which he ha within him justic is the greatest good and injustic the greatest evil had thi been the univers strain had you sought to persuad us of thi from our youth upward we should not have been on the watch to keep on anoth from do wrong but everi on would have been hi own watchman becaus afraid if he did wrong of harbour in himself the greatest of evil i dare sai that thrasymachu and other would serious hold the languag which i have been mere repeat and word even stronger than these about justic and injustic grossli as i conceiv pervert their true natur but i speak in thi vehement manner as i must frankli confess to you becaus i want to hear from you the opposit side and i would ask you to show not onli the superior which justic ha over injustic but what effect thei have on the possessor of them which make the on to be a good and the other an evil to him and pleas as glaucon request of you to exclud reput for unless you take awai from each of them hi true reput and add on the fals we shall sai that you do not prais justic but the appear of it we shall think that you ar onli exhort us to keep injustic dark and that you realli agre with thrasymachu in think that justic is anoth good and the interest of the stronger and that injustic is a man own profit and interest though injuri to the weaker now as you have admit that justic is on of that highest class of good which ar desir inde for their result but in a far greater degre for their own sakeslik sight or hear or knowledg or health or ani other real and natur and not mere convent goodi would ask you in your prais of justic to regard on point onli i mean the essenti good and evil which justic and injustic work in the possessor of them let other prais justic and censur injustic magnifi the reward and honour of the on and abus the other that is a manner of argu which come from them i am readi to toler but from you who have spent your whole life in the consider of thi question unless i hear the contrari from your own lip i expect someth better and therefor i sai not onli prove to us that justic is better than injustic but show what thei either of them do to the possessor of them which make the on to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by god and men i had alwai admir the geniu of glaucon and adeimantu but on hear these word i wa quit delight and said son of an illustri father that wa not a bad begin of the elegiac vers which the admir of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguish yourselv at the battl of megara son of ariston he sang divin offspr of an illustri hero the epithet is veri appropri for there is someth truli divin in be abl to argu as you have done for the superior of injustic and remain unconvinc by your own argument and i do believ that you ar not convincedthi i infer from your gener charact for had i judg onli from your speech i should have mistrust you but now the greater my confid in you the greater is my difficulti in know what to sai for i am in a strait between two on the on hand i feel that i am unequ to the task and my inabl is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfi with the answer which i made to thrasymachu prove as i thought the superior which justic ha over injustic and yet i cannot refus to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impieti in be present when justic is evil spoken of and not lift up a hand in her defenc and therefor i had best give such help as i can glaucon and the rest entreat me by all mean not to let the question drop but to proce in the investig thei want to arriv at the truth first about the natur of justic and injustic and secondli about their rel advantag i told them what i realli thought that the enquiri would be of a seriou natur and would requir veri good ey see then i said that we ar no great wit i think that we had better adopt a method which i mai illustr thu suppos that a shortsight person had been ask by some on to read small letter from a distanc and it occur to some on els that thei might be found in anoth place which wa larger and in which the letter were largerif thei were the same and he could read the larger letter first and then proce to the lesserthi would have been thought a rare piec of good fortun veri true said adeimantu but how doe the illustr appli to our enquiri i will tell you i repli justic which is the subject of our enquiri is as you know sometim spoken of as the virtu of an individu and sometim as the virtu of a state true he repli and is not a state larger than an individu it is then in the larger the quantiti of justic is like to be larger and more easili discern i propos therefor that we enquir into the natur of justic and injustic first as thei appear in the state and secondli in the individu proceed from the greater to the lesser and compar them that he said is an excel propos and if we imagin the state in process of creation we shall see the justic and injustic of the state in process of creation also i dare sai when the state is complet there mai be a hope that the object of our search will be more easili discov ye far more easili but ought we to attempt to construct on i said for to do so as i am inclin to think will be a veri seriou task reflect therefor i have reflect said adeimantu and am anxiou that you should proce a state i said aris as i conceiv out of the need of mankind no on is selfsuff but all of us have mani want can ani other origin of a state be imagin there can be no other then as we have mani want and mani person ar need to suppli them on take a helper for on purpos and anoth for anoth and when these partner and helper ar gather togeth in on habit the bodi of inhabit is term a state true he said and thei exchang with on anoth and on give and anoth receiv under the idea that the exchang will be for their good veri true then i said let us begin and creat in idea a state and yet the true creator is necess who is the mother of our invent of cours he repli now the first and greatest of necess is food which is the condit of life and exist certainli the second is a dwell and the third cloth and the like true and now let us see how our citi will be abl to suppli thi great demand we mai suppos that on man is a husbandman anoth a builder some on els a weavershal we add to them a shoemak or perhap some other purveyor to our bodili want quit right the barest notion of a state must includ four or five men clearli and how will thei proce will each bring the result of hi labour into a common stockth individu husbandman for exampl produc for four and labour four time as long and as much as he need in the provis of food with which he suppli other as well as himself or will he have noth to do with other and not be at the troubl of produc for them but provid for himself alon a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remain three fourth of hi time be emploi in make a hous or a coat or a pair of shoe have no partnership with other but suppli himself all hi own want adeimantu thought that he should aim at produc food onli and not at produc everyth probabl i repli that would be the better wai and when i hear you sai thi i am myself remind that we ar not all alik there ar divers of natur among us which ar adapt to differ occup veri true and will you have a work better done when the workman ha mani occup or when he ha onli on when he ha onli on further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time no doubt for busi is not dispos to wait until the doer of the busi is at leisur but the doer must follow up what he is do and make the busi hi first object he must and if so we must infer that all thing ar produc more plentifulli and easili and of a better qualiti when on man doe on thing which is natur to him and doe it at the right time and leav other thing undoubtedli then more than four citizen will be requir for the husbandman will not make hi own plough or mattock or other implement of agricultur if thei ar to be good for anyth neither will the builder make hi toolsand he too need mani and in like manner the weaver and shoemak true then carpent and smith and mani other artisan will be sharer in our littl state which is alreadi begin to grow true yet even if we add neatherd shepherd and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen mai have oxen to plough with and builder as well as husbandmen mai have draught cattl and currier and weaver fleec and hidesstil our state will not be veri larg that is true yet neither will it be a veri small state which contain all these then again there is the situat of the cityto find a place where noth need be import is wellnigh imposs imposs then there must be anoth class of citizen who will bring the requir suppli from anoth citi there must but if the trader goe emptyhand have noth which thei requir who would suppli hi need he will come back emptyhand that is certain and therefor what thei produc at home must be not onli enough for themselv but such both in quantiti and qualiti as to accommod those from whom their want ar suppli veri true then more husbandmen and more artisan will be requir thei will not to mention the import and export who ar call merchant ye then we shall want merchant we shall and if merchandis is to be carri over the sea skil sailor will also be need and in consider number ye in consider number then again within the citi how will thei exchang their product to secur such an exchang wa as you will rememb on of our princip object when we form them into a societi and constitut a state clearli thei will bui and sell then thei will need a marketplac and a moneytoken for purpos of exchang certainli suppos now that a husbandman or an artisan bring some product to market and he come at a time when there is no on to exchang with himi he to leav hi call and sit idl in the marketplac not at all he will find peopl there who see the want undertak the offic of salesmen in wellord state thei ar commonli those who ar the weakest in bodili strength and therefor of littl us for ani other purpos their duti is to be in the market and to give monei in exchang for good to those who desir to sell and to take monei from those who desir to bui thi want then creat a class of retailtrad in our state is not retail the term which is appli to those who sit in the marketplac engag in bui and sell while those who wander from on citi to anoth ar call merchant ye he said and there is anoth class of servant who ar intellectu hardli on the level of companionship still thei have plenti of bodili strength for labour which accordingli thei sell and ar call if i do not mistak hirel hire be the name which is given to the price of their labour true then hirel will help to make up our popul ye and now adeimantu is our state matur and perfect i think so where then is justic and where is injustic and in what part of the state did thei spring up probabl in the deal of these citizen with on anoth i cannot imagin that thei ar more like to be found ani where els i dare sai that you ar right in your suggest i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiri let us then consid first of all what will be their wai of life now that we have thu establish them will thei not produc corn and wine and cloth and shoe and build hous for themselv and when thei ar hous thei will work in summer commonli strip and barefoot but in winter substanti cloth and shod thei will feed on barleym and flour of wheat bake and knead them make nobl cake and loav these thei will serv up on a mat of reed or on clean leav themselv reclin the while upon bed strewn with yew or myrtl and thei and their children will feast drink of the wine which thei have made wear garland on their head and hymn the prais of the god in happi convers with on anoth and thei will take care that their famili do not exce their mean have an ey to poverti or war but said glaucon interpos you have not given them a relish to their meal true i repli i had forgotten of cours thei must have a relishsalt and oliv and chees and thei will boil root and herb such as countri peopl prepar for a dessert we shall give them fig and pea and bean and thei will roast myrtleberri and acorn at the fire drink in moder and with such a diet thei mai be expect to live in peac and health to a good old ag and bequeath a similar life to their children after them ye socrat he said and if you were provid for a citi of pig how els would you feed the beast but what would you have glaucon i repli why he said you should give them the ordinari conveni of life peopl who ar to be comfort ar accustom to lie on sofa and dine off tabl and thei should have sauc and sweet in the modern style ye i said now i understand the question which you would have me consid is not onli how a state but how a luxuri state is creat and possibl there is no harm in thi for in such a state we shall be more like to see how justic and injustic origin in my opinion the true and healthi constitut of the state is the on which i have describ but if you wish also to see a state at feverheat i have no object for i suspect that mani will not be satisfi with the simpler wai of life thei will be for ad sofa and tabl and other furnitur also dainti and perfum and incens and courtesan and cake all these not of on sort onli but in everi varieti we must go beyond the necessari of which i wa at first speak such as hous and cloth and shoe the art of the painter and the embroider will have to be set in motion and gold and ivori and all sort of materi must be procur true he said then we must enlarg our border for the origin healthi state is no longer suffici now will the citi have to fill and swell with a multitud of call which ar not requir by ani natur want such as the whole tribe of hunter and actor of whom on larg class have to do with form and colour anoth will be the votari of musicpoet and their attend train of rhapsodist player dancer contractor also maker of diver kind of articl includ women dress and we shall want more servant will not tutor be also in request and nurs wet and dry tirewomen and barber as well as confection and cook and swineherd too who were not need and therefor had no place in the former edit of our state but ar need now thei must not be forgotten and there will be anim of mani other kind if peopl eat them certainli and live in thi wai we shall have much greater need of physician than befor much greater and the countri which wa enough to support the origin inhabit will be too small now and not enough quit true then a slice of our neighbour land will be want by us for pastur and tillag and thei will want a slice of our if like ourselv thei exce the limit of necess and give themselv up to the unlimit accumul of wealth that socrat will be inevit and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not most certainli he repli then without determin as yet whether war doe good or harm thu much we mai affirm that now we have discov war to be deriv from caus which ar also the caus of almost all the evil in state privat as well as public undoubtedli and our state must onc more enlarg and thi time the enlarg will be noth short of a whole armi which will have to go out and fight with the invad for all that we have as well as for the thing and person whom we were describ abov why he said ar thei not capabl of defend themselv no i said not if we were right in the principl which wa acknowledg by all of us when we were frame the state the principl as you will rememb wa that on man cannot practis mani art with success veri true he said but is not war an art certainli and an art requir as much attent as shoemak quit true and the shoemak wa not allow by us to be a husbandman or a weaver or a builderin order that we might have our shoe well made but to him and to everi other worker wa assign on work for which he wa by natur fit and at that he wa to continu work all hi life long and at no other he wa not to let opportun slip and then he would becom a good workman now noth can be more import than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easili acquir that a man mai be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemak or other artisan although no on in the world would be a good dice or draught player who mere took up the game as a recreat and had not from hi earliest year devot himself to thi and noth els no tool will make a man a skill workman or master of defenc nor be of ani us to him who ha not learn how to handl them and ha never bestow ani attent upon them how then will he who take up a shield or other implement of war becom a good fighter all in a dai whether with heavyarm or ani other kind of troop ye he said the tool which would teach men their own us would be beyond price and the higher the duti of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and applic will be need by him no doubt he repli will he not also requir natur aptitud for hi call certainli then it will be our duti to select if we can natur which ar fit for the task of guard the citi it will and the select will be no easi matter i said but we must be brave and do our best we must is not the nobl youth veri like a wellbr dog in respect of guard and watch what do you mean i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtak the enemi when thei see him and strong too if when thei have caught him thei have to fight with him all these qualiti he repli will certainli be requir by them well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well certainli and is he like to be brave who ha no spirit whether hors or dog or ani other anim have you never observ how invinc and unconquer is spirit and how the presenc of it make the soul of ani creatur to be absolut fearless and indomit i have then now we have a clear notion of the bodili qualiti which ar requir in the guardian true and also of the mental on hi soul is to be full of spirit ye but ar not these spirit natur apt to be savag with on anoth and with everybodi els a difficulti by no mean easi to overcom he repli wherea i said thei ought to be danger to their enemi and gentl to their friend if not thei will destroi themselv without wait for their enemi to destroi them true he said what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentl natur which ha also a great spirit for the on is the contradict of the other true he will not be a good guardian who is want in either of these two qualiti and yet the combin of them appear to be imposs and henc we must infer that to be a good guardian is imposs i am afraid that what you sai is true he repli here feel perplex i began to think over what had precededmi friend i said no wonder that we ar in a perplex for we have lost sight of the imag which we had befor us what do you mean he said i mean to sai that there do exist natur gift with those opposit qualiti and where do you find them mani anim i repli furnish exampl of them our friend the dog is a veri good on you know that wellbr dog ar perfectli gentl to their familiar and acquaint and the revers to stranger ye i know then there is noth imposs or out of the order of natur in our find a guardian who ha a similar combin of qualiti certainli not would not he who is fit to be a guardian besid the spirit natur need to have the qualiti of a philosoph i do not apprehend your mean the trait of which i am speak i repli mai be also seen in the dog and is remark in the anim what trait why a dog whenev he see a stranger is angri when an acquaint he welcom him although the on ha never done him ani harm nor the other ani good did thi never strike you as curiou the matter never struck me befor but i quit recognis the truth of your remark and sure thi instinct of the dog is veri charmingyour dog is a true philosoph why why becaus he distinguish the face of a friend and of an enemi onli by the criterion of know and not know and must not an anim be a lover of learn who determin what he like and dislik by the test of knowledg and ignor most assuredli and is not the love of learn the love of wisdom which is philosophi thei ar the same he repli and mai we not sai confid of man also that he who is like to be gentl to hi friend and acquaint must by natur be a lover of wisdom and knowledg that we mai safe affirm then he who is to be a realli good and nobl guardian of the state will requir to unit in himself philosophi and spirit and swift and strength undoubtedli then we have found the desir natur and now that we have found them how ar thei to be rear and educ is not thi an enquiri which mai be expect to throw light on the greater enquiri which is our final endhow do justic and injustic grow up in state for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconveni length adeimantu thought that the enquiri would be of great servic to us then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long certainli not come then and let us pass a leisur hour in storytel and our stori shall be the educ of our hero by all mean and what shall be their educ can we find a better than the tradit sortand thi ha two divis gymnast for the bodi and music for the soul true shall we begin educ with music and go on to gymnast afterward by all mean and when you speak of music do you includ literatur or not i do and literatur mai be either true or fals ye and the young should be train in both kind and we begin with the fals i do not understand your mean he said you know i said that we begin by tell children stori which though not wholli destitut of truth ar in the main fictiti and these stori ar told them when thei ar not of an ag to learn gymnast veri true that wa my mean when i said that we must teach music befor gymnast quit right he said you know also that the begin is the most import part of ani work especi in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the charact is be form and the desir impress is more readili taken quit true and shall we just carelessli allow children to hear ani casual tale which mai be devis by casual person and to receiv into their mind idea for the most part the veri opposit of those which we should wish them to have when thei ar grown up we cannot then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writer of fiction and let the censor receiv ani tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desir mother and nurs to tell their children the authoris on onli let them fashion the mind with such tale even more fondli than thei mould the bodi with their hand but most of those which ar now in us must be discard of what tale ar you speak he said you mai find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for thei ar necessarili of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them veri like he repli but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater those i said which ar narrat by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poet who have ever been the great storytel of mankind but which stori do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them a fault which is most seriou i said the fault of tell a lie and what is more a bad lie but when is thi fault commit whenev an erron represent is made of the natur of god and heroesa when a painter paint a portrait not have the shadow of a like to the origin ye he said that sort of thing is certainli veri blameabl but what ar the stori which you mean first of all i said there wa that greatest of all li in high place which the poet told about uranu and which wa a bad lie tooi mean what hesiod sai that uranu did and how cronu retali on him the do of cronu and the suffer which in turn hi son inflict upon him even if thei were true ought certainli not to be lightli told to young and thoughtless person if possibl thei had better be buri in silenc but if there is an absolut necess for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mysteri and thei should sacrific not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocur victim and then the number of the hearer will be veri few inde why ye said he those stori ar extrem objection ye adeimantu thei ar stori not to be repeat in our state the young man should not be told that in commit the worst of crime he is far from do anyth outrag and that even if he chastis hi father when he doe wrong in whatev manner he will onli be follow the exampl of the first and greatest among the god i entir agre with you he said in my opinion those stori ar quit unfit to be repeat neither if we mean our futur guardian to regard the habit of quarrel among themselv as of all thing the basest should ani word be said to them of the war in heaven and of the plot and fight of the god against on anoth for thei ar not true no we shall never mention the battl of the giant or let them be embroid on garment and we shall be silent about the innumer other quarrel of god and hero with their friend and rel if thei would onli believ us we would tell them that quarrel is unholi and that never up to thi time ha there been ani quarrel between citizen thi is what old men and old women should begin by tell children and when thei grow up the poet also should be told to compos for them in a similar spirit but the narr of hephaestu bind here hi mother or how on anoth occas zeu sent him fly for take her part when she wa be beaten and all the battl of the god in homerthes tale must not be admit into our state whether thei ar suppos to have an allegor mean or not for a young person cannot judg what is allegor and what is liter anyth that he receiv into hi mind at that ag is like to becom indel and unalter and therefor it is most import that the tale which the young first hear should be model of virtuou thought there you ar right he repli but if ani on ask where ar such model to be found and of what tale ar you speakinghow shall we answer him i said to him you and i adeimantu at thi moment ar not poet but founder of a state now the founder of a state ought to know the gener form in which poet should cast their tale and the limit which must be observ by them but to make the tale is not their busi veri true he said but what ar these form of theologi which you mean someth of thi kind i repliedgod is alwai to be repres as he truli is whatev be the sort of poetri epic lyric or tragic in which the represent is given right and is he not truli good and must he not be repres as such certainli and no good thing is hurt no inde and that which is not hurt hurt not certainli not and that which hurt not doe no evil no and can that which doe no evil be a caus of evil imposs and the good is advantag ye and therefor the caus of wellb ye it follow therefor that the good is not the caus of all thing but of the good onli assuredli then god if he be good is not the author of all thing as the mani assert but he is the caus of a few thing onli and not of most thing that occur to men for few ar the good of human life and mani ar the evil and the good is to be attribut to god alon of the evil the caus ar to be sought elsewher and not in him that appear to me to be most true he said then we must not listen to homer or to ani other poet who is guilti of the folli of sai that two cask lie at the threshold of zeu full of lot on of good the other of evil lot and that he to whom zeu give a mixtur of the two sometim meet with evil fortun at other time with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingl ill him wild hunger drive oer the beauteou earth and again zeu who is the dispens of good and evil to us and if ani on assert that the violat of oath and treati which wa realli the work of pandaru wa brought about by athen and zeu or that the strife and content of the god wa instig by themi and zeu he shall not have our approv neither will we allow our young men to hear the word of aeschylu that god plant guilt among men when he desir utterli to destroi a hous and if a poet write of the suffer of niobeth subject of the tragedi in which these iambic vers occuror of the hous of pelop or of the trojan war or on ani similar theme either we must not permit him to sai that these ar the work of god or if thei ar of god he must devis some explan of them such as we ar seek he must sai that god did what wa just and right and thei were the better for be punish but that those who ar punish ar miser and that god is the author of their miseryth poet is not to be permit to sai though he mai sai that the wick ar miser becaus thei requir to be punish and ar benefit by receiv punish from god but that god be good is the author of evil to ani on is to be strenuous deni and not to be said or sung or heard in vers or prose by ani on whether old or young in ani wellord commonwealth such a fiction is suicid ruinou impiou i agre with you he repli and am readi to give my assent to the law let thi then be on of our rule and principl concern the god to which our poet and recit will be expect to conformthat god is not the author of all thing but of good onli that will do he said and what do you think of a second principl shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a natur to appear insidi now in on shape and now in anothersometim himself chang and pass into mani form sometim deceiv us with the semblanc of such transform or is he on and the same immut fix in hi own proper imag i cannot answer you he said without more thought well i said but if we suppos a chang in anyth that chang must be effect either by the thing itself or by some other thing most certainli and thing which ar at their best ar also least liabl to be alter or discompos for exampl when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liabl to be affect by meat and drink and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffer least from wind or the heat of the sun or ani similar caus of cours and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confus or derang by ani extern influenc true and the same principl as i should suppos appli to all composit thingsfurnitur hous garment when good and well made thei ar least alter by time and circumst veri true then everyth which is good whether made by art or natur or both is least liabl to suffer chang from without true but sure god and the thing of god ar in everi wai perfect of cours thei ar then he can hardli be compel by extern influenc to take mani shape he cannot but mai he not chang and transform himself clearli he said that must be the case if he is chang at all and will he then chang himself for the better and fairer or for the wors and more unsightli if he chang at all he can onli chang for the wors for we cannot suppos him to be defici either in virtu or beauti veri true adeimantu but then would ani on whether god or man desir to make himself wors imposs then it is imposs that god should ever be will to chang be as is suppos the fairest and best that is conceiv everi god remain absolut and for ever in hi own form that necessarili follow he said in my judgment then i said my dear friend let none of the poet tell us that the god take the disguis of stranger from other land walk up and down citi in all sort of form and let no on slander proteu and theti neither let ani on either in tragedi or in ani other kind of poetri introduc here disguis in the like of a priestess ask an alm for the lifegiv daughter of inachu the river of argo let us have no more li of that sort neither must we have mother under the influenc of the poet scare their children with a bad version of these mythstel how certain god as thei sai go about by night in the like of so mani stranger and in diver form but let them take heed lest thei make coward of their children and at the same time speak blasphemi against the god heaven forbid he said but although the god ar themselv unchang still by witchcraft and decept thei mai make us think that thei appear in variou form perhap he repli well but can you imagin that god will be will to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself i cannot sai he repli do you not know i said that the true lie if such an express mai be allow is hate of god and men what do you mean he said i mean that no on is willingli deceiv in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matter there abov all he is most afraid of a lie have possess of him still he said i do not comprehend you the reason is i repli that you attribut some profound mean to my word but i am onli sai that decept or be deceiv or uninform about the highest realiti in the highest part of themselv which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least likethat i sai is what thei utterli detest there is noth more hate to them and as i wa just now remark thi ignor in the soul of him who is deceiv mai be call the true lie for the lie in word is onli a kind of imit and shadowi imag of a previou affect of the soul not pure unadulter falsehood am i not right perfectli right the true lie is hate not onli by the god but also by men ye wherea the lie in word is in certain case us and not hate in deal with enemiesthat would be an instanc or again when those whom we call our friend in a fit of mad or illus ar go to do some harm then it is us and is a sort of medicin or prevent also in the tale of mytholog of which we were just now speakingbecaus we do not know the truth about ancient time we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account veri true he said but can ani of these reason appli to god can we suppos that he is ignor of antiqu and therefor ha recours to invent that would be ridicul he said then the ly poet ha no place in our idea of god i should sai not or perhap he mai tell a lie becaus he is afraid of enemi that is inconceiv but he mai have friend who ar senseless or mad but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god then no motiv can be imagin why god should lie none whatev then the superhuman and divin is absolut incap of falsehood ye then is god perfectli simpl and true both in word and deed he chang not he deceiv not either by sign or word by dream or wake vision your thought he said ar the reflect of my own you agre with me then i said that thi is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divin thing the god ar not magician who transform themselv neither do thei deceiv mankind in ani wai i grant that then although we ar admir of homer we do not admir the ly dream which zeu send to agamemnon neither will we prais the vers of aeschylu in which theti sai that apollo at her nuptial wa celebr in song her fair progeni whose dai were to be long and to know no sick and when he had spoken of my lot as in all thing bless of heaven he rais a note of triumph and cheer my soul and i thought that the word of phoebu be divin and full of propheci would not fail and now he himself who utter the strain he who wa present at the banquet and who said thish it is who ha slain my son these ar the kind of sentiment about the god which will arous our anger and he who utter them shall be refus a choru neither shall we allow teacher to make us of them in the instruct of the young mean as we do that our guardian as far as men can be should be true worshipp of the god and like them i entir agre he said in these principl and promis to make them my law book iii such then i said ar our principl of theologysom tale ar to be told and other ar not to be told to our discipl from their youth upward if we mean them to honour the god and their parent and to valu friendship with on anoth ye and i think that our principl ar right he said but if thei ar to be courag must thei not learn other lesson besid these and lesson of such a kind as will take awai the fear of death can ani man be courag who ha the fear of death in him certainli not he said and can he be fearless of death or will he choos death in battl rather than defeat and slaveri who believ the world below to be real and terribl imposs then we must assum a control over the narrat of thi class of tale as well as over the other and beg them not simpli to revil but rather to commend the world below intim to them that their descript ar untru and will do harm to our futur warrior that will be our duti he said then i said we shall have to obliter mani obnoxi passag begin with the vers i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expung the vers which tell us how pluto fear lest the mansion grim and squalid which the god abhor should be seen both of mortal and immort and again o heaven verili in the hous of hade there is soul and ghostli form but no mind at all again of tiresia to him even after death did persephon grant mind that he alon should be wise but the other soul ar flit shade again the soul fly from the limb had gone to hade lament her fate leav manhood and youth again and the soul with shrill cry pass like smoke beneath the earth and as bat in hollow of mystic cavern whenev ani of them ha drop out of the string and fall from the rock fly shrill and cling to on anoth so did thei with shrill cry hold togeth as thei move and we must beg homer and the other poet not to be angri if we strike out these and similar passag not becaus thei ar unpoet or unattract to the popular ear but becaus the greater the poetic charm of them the less ar thei meet for the ear of boi and men who ar meant to be free and who should fear slaveri more than death undoubtedli also we shall have to reject all the terribl and appal name which describ the world belowcocytu and styx ghost under the earth and sapless shade and ani similar word of which the veri mention caus a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hear them i do not sai that these horribl stori mai not have a us of some kind but there is a danger that the nerv of our guardian mai be render too excit and effemin by them there is a real danger he said then we must have no more of them true anoth and a nobler strain must be compos and sung by us clearli and shall we proce to get rid of the weep and wail of famou men thei will go with the rest but shall we be right in get rid of them reflect our principl is that the good man will not consid death terribl to ani other good man who is hi comrad ye that is our principl and therefor he will not sorrow for hi depart friend as though he had suffer anyth terribl he will not such an on as we further maintain is suffici for himself and hi own happi and therefor is least in need of other men true he said and for thi reason the loss of a son or brother or the depriv of fortun is to him of all men least terribl assuredli and therefor he will be least like to lament and will bear with the greatest equanim ani misfortun of thi sort which mai befal him ye he will feel such a misfortun far less than anoth then we shall be right in get rid of the lament of famou men and make them over to women and not even to women who ar good for anyth or to men of a baser sort that those who ar be educ by us to be the defend of their countri mai scorn to do the like that will be veri right then we will onc more entreat homer and the other poet not to depict achil who is the son of a goddess first ly on hi side then on hi back and then on hi face then start up and sail in a frenzi along the shore of the barren sea now take the sooti ash in both hi hand and pour them over hi head or weep and wail in the variou mode which homer ha delin nor should he describ priam the kinsman of the god as prai and beseech roll in the dirt call each man loudli by hi name still more earnestli will we beg of him at all event not to introduc the god lament and sai ala my miseri ala that i bore the bravest to my sorrow but if he must introduc the god at ani rate let him not dare so complet to misrepres the greatest of the god as to make him sai o heaven with my ey verili i behold a dear friend of mine chase round and round the citi and my heart is sorrow or again woe is me that i am fate to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdu at the hand of patroclu the son of menoetiu for if my sweet adeimantu our youth serious listen to such unworthi represent of the god instead of laugh at them as thei ought hardli will ani of them deem that he himself be but a man can be dishonour by similar action neither will he rebuk ani inclin which mai aris in hi mind to sai and do the like and instead of have ani shame or selfcontrol he will be alwai whine and lament on slight occas ye he said that is most true ye i repli but that sure is what ought not to be as the argument ha just prove to us and by that proof we must abid until it is disprov by a better it ought not to be neither ought our guardian to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which ha been indulg to excess almost alwai produc a violent reaction so i believ then person of worth even if onli mortal men must not be repres as overcom by laughter and still less must such a represent of the god be allow still less of the god as you sai he repli then we shall not suffer such an express to be us about the god as that of homer when he describ how inextinguish laughter aros among the bless god when thei saw hephaestu bustl about the mansion on your view we must not admit them on my view if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain again truth should be highli valu if as we were sai a lie is useless to the god and us onli as a medicin to men then the us of such medicin should be restrict to physician privat individu have no busi with them clearli not he said then if ani on at all is to have the privileg of ly the ruler of the state should be the person and thei in their deal either with enemi or with their own citizen mai be allow to lie for the public good but nobodi els should meddl with anyth of the kind and although the ruler have thi privileg for a privat man to lie to them in return is to be deem a more heinou fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about hi own bodili ill to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happen about the ship and the rest of the crew and how thing ar go with himself or hi fellow sailor most true he said if then the ruler catch anybodi besid himself ly in the state ani of the craftsmen whether he be priest or physician or carpent he will punish him for introduc a practic which is equal subvers and destruct of ship or state most certainli he said if our idea of the state is ever carri out in the next place our youth must be temper certainli ar not the chief element of temper speak gener obedi to command and selfcontrol in sensual pleasur true then we shall approv such languag as that of diomed in homer friend sit still and obei my word and the vers which follow the greek march breath prowess in silent aw of their leader and other sentiment of the same kind we shall what of thi line o heavi with wine who hast the ey of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the word which follow would you sai that these or ani similar impertin which privat individu ar suppos to address to their ruler whether in vers or prose ar well or ill spoken thei ar ill spoken thei mai veri possibl afford some amus but thei do not conduc to temper and therefor thei ar like to do harm to our young menyou would agre with me there ye and then again to make the wisest of men sai that noth in hi opinion is more gloriou than when the tabl ar full of bread and meat and the cupbear carri round wine which he draw from the bowl and pour into the cup is it fit or conduc to temper for a young man to hear such word or the vers the saddest of fate is to die and meet destini from hunger what would you sai again to the tale of zeu who while other god and men were asleep and he the onli person awak lai devis plan but forgot them all in a moment through hi lust and wa so complet overcom at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but want to lie with her on the ground declar that he had never been in such a state of raptur befor even when thei first met on anoth without the knowledg of their parent or that other tale of how hephaestu becaus of similar go on cast a chain around ar and aphrodit inde he said i am strongli of opinion that thei ought not to hear that sort of thing but ani deed of endur which ar done or told by famou men these thei ought to see and hear as for exampl what is said in the vers he smote hi breast and thu reproach hi heart endur my heart far wors hast thou endur certainli he said in the next place we must not let them be receiv of gift or lover of monei certainli not neither must we sing to them of gift persuad god and persuad reverend king neither is phoenix the tutor of achil to be approv or deem to have given hi pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gift of the greek and assist them but that without a gift he should not lai asid hi anger neither will we believ or acknowledg achil himself to have been such a lover of monei that he took agamemnon gift or that when he had receiv payment he restor the dead bodi of hector but that without payment he wa unwil to do so undoubtedli he said these ar not sentiment which can be approv love homer as i do i hardli like to sai that in attribut these feel to achil or in believ that thei ar truli attribut to him he is guilti of downright impieti as littl can i believ the narr of hi insol to apollo where he sai thou hast wrong me o fardart most abomin of deiti verili i would be even with thee if i had onli the power or hi insubordin to the rivergod on whose divin he is readi to lai hand or hi offer to the dead patroclu of hi own hair which had been previous dedic to the other rivergod spercheiu and that he actual perform thi vow or that he drag hector round the tomb of patroclu and slaughter the captiv at the pyre of all thi i cannot believ that he wa guilti ani more than i can allow our citizen to believ that he the wise cheiron pupil the son of a goddess and of peleu who wa the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeu wa so disord in hi wit as to be at on time the slave of two seemingli inconsist passion mean not untaint by avaric combin with overween contempt of god and men you ar quit right he repli and let us equal refus to believ or allow to be repeat the tale of theseu son of poseidon or of peirith son of zeu go forth as thei did to perpetr a horrid rape or of ani other hero or son of a god dare to do such impiou and dread thing as thei fals ascrib to them in our dai and let us further compel the poet to declar either that these act were not done by them or that thei were not the son of godsboth in the same breath thei shall not be permit to affirm we will not have them try to persuad our youth that the god ar the author of evil and that hero ar no better than mensenti which as we were sai ar neither piou nor true for we have alreadi prove that evil cannot come from the god assuredli not and further thei ar like to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybodi will begin to excus hi own vice when he is convinc that similar wicked ar alwai be perpetr by the kindr of the god the rel of zeu whose ancestr altar the altar of zeu is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have the blood of deiti yet flow in their vein and therefor let us put an end to such tale lest thei engend laxiti of moral among the young by all mean he repli but now that we ar determin what class of subject ar or ar not to be spoken of let us see whether ani have been omit by us the manner in which god and demigod and hero and the world below should be treat ha been alreadi laid down veri true and what shall we sai about men that is clearli the remain portion of our subject clearli so but we ar not in a condit to answer thi question at present my friend why not becaus if i am not mistaken we shall have to sai that about men poet and storytel ar guilti of make the gravest misstat when thei tell us that wick men ar often happi and the good miser and that injustic is profit when undetect but that justic is a man own loss and anoth gainthes thing we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and sai the opposit to be sure we shall he repli but if you admit that i am right in thi then i shall maintain that you have impli the principl for which we have been all along contend i grant the truth of your infer that such thing ar or ar not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determin until we have discov what justic is and how natur advantag to the possessor whether he seem to be just or not most true he said enough of the subject of poetri let us now speak of the style and when thi ha been consid both matter and manner will have been complet treat i do not understand what you mean said adeimantu then i must make you understand and perhap i mai be more intellig if i put the matter in thi wai you ar awar i suppos that all mytholog and poetri is a narrat of event either past present or to come certainli he repli and narrat mai be either simpl narrat or imit or a union of the two that again he said i do not quit understand i fear that i must be a ridicul teacher when i have so much difficulti in make myself apprehend like a bad speaker therefor i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piec off in illustr of my mean you know the first line of the iliad in which the poet sai that chryse prai agamemnon to releas hi daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryse fail of hi object invok the anger of the god against the achaean now as far as these line and he prai all the greek but especi the two son of atreu the chief of the peopl the poet is speak in hi own person he never lead us to suppos that he is ani on els but in what follow he take the person of chryse and then he doe all that he can to make us believ that the speaker is not homer but the ag priest himself and in thi doubl form he ha cast the entir narr of the event which occur at troi and in ithaca and throughout the odyssei ye and a narr it remain both in the speech which the poet recit from time to time and in the intermedi passag quit true but when the poet speak in the person of anoth mai we not sai that he assimil hi style to that of the person who as he inform you is go to speak certainli and thi assimil of himself to anoth either by the us of voic or gestur is the imit of the person whose charact he assum of cours then in thi case the narr of the poet mai be said to proce by wai of imit veri true or if the poet everywher appear and never conceal himself then again the imit is drop and hi poetri becom simpl narrat howev in order that i mai make my mean quit clear and that you mai no more sai i dont understand i will show how the chang might be effect if homer had said the priest came have hi daughter ransom in hi hand supplic the achaean and abov all the king and then if instead of speak in the person of chryse he had continu in hi own person the word would have been not imit but simpl narrat the passag would have run as follow i am no poet and therefor i drop the metr the priest came and prai the god on behalf of the greek that thei might captur troi and return safe home but beg that thei would give him back hi daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thu he spoke and the other greek rever the priest and assent but agamemnon wa wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplet of the god should be of no avail to himth daughter of chryse should not be releas he saidsh should grow old with him in argo and then he told him to go awai and not to provok him if he intend to get home unscath and the old man went awai in fear and silenc and when he had left the camp he call upon apollo by hi mani name remind him of everyth which he had done pleas to him whether in build hi templ or in offer sacrific and prai that hi good deed might be return to him and that the achaean might expiat hi tear by the arrow of the godand so on in thi wai the whole becom simpl narr i understand he said or you mai suppos the opposit casethat the intermedi passag ar omit and the dialogu onli left that also he said i understand you mean for exampl as in tragedi you have conceiv my mean perfectli and if i mistak not what you fail to apprehend befor is now made clear to you that poetri and mytholog ar in some case wholli imitativeinst of thi ar suppli by tragedi and comedi there is likewis the opposit style in which the poet is the onli speakerof thi the dithyramb afford the best exampl and the combin of both is found in epic and in sever other style of poetri do i take you with me ye he said i see now what you meant i will ask you to rememb also what i began by sai that we had done with the subject and might proce to the style ye i rememb in sai thi i intend to impli that we must come to an understand about the mimet artwheth the poet in narrat their stori ar to be allow by us to imit and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what part or should all imit be prohibit you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedi and comedi shall be admit into our state ye i said but there mai be more than thi in question i realli do not know as yet but whither the argument mai blow thither we go and go we will he said then adeimantu let me ask you whether our guardian ought to be imit or rather ha not thi question been decid by the rule alreadi laid down that on man can onli do on thing well and not mani and that if he attempt mani he will altogeth fail of gain much reput in ani certainli and thi is equal true of imit no on man can imit mani thing as well as he would imit a singl on he cannot then the same person will hardli be abl to plai a seriou part in life and at the same time to be an imit and imit mani other part as well for even when two speci of imit ar nearli alli the same person cannot succe in both as for exampl the writer of tragedi and comedydid you not just now call them imit ye i did and you ar right in think that the same person cannot succe in both ani more than thei can be rhapsodist and actor at onc true neither ar comic and tragic actor the same yet all these thing ar but imit thei ar so and human natur adeimantu appear to have been coin into yet smaller piec and to be as incap of imit mani thing well as of perform well the action of which the imit ar copi quit true he repli if then we adher to our origin notion and bear in mind that our guardian set asid everi other busi ar to dedic themselv wholli to the mainten of freedom in the state make thi their craft and engag in no work which doe not bear on thi end thei ought not to practis or imit anyth els if thei imit at all thei should imit from youth upward onli those charact which ar suitabl to their professionth courag temper holi free and the like but thei should not depict or be skil at imit ani kind of illiber or base lest from imit thei should come to be what thei imit did you never observ how imit begin in earli youth and continu far into life at length grow into habit and becom a second natur affect bodi voic and mind ye certainli he said then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we sai that thei ought to be good men to imit a woman whether young or old quarrel with her husband or strive and vaunt against the god in conceit of her happi or when she is in afflict or sorrow or weep and certainli not on who is in sick love or labour veri right he said neither must thei repres slave male or femal perform the offic of slave thei must not and sure not bad men whether coward or ani other who do the revers of what we have just been prescrib who scold or mock or revil on anoth in drink or out of drink or who in ani other manner sin against themselv and their neighbour in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should thei be train to imit the action or speech of men or women who ar mad or bad for mad like vice is to be known but not to be practis or imit veri true he repli neither mai thei imit smith or other artific or oarsmen or boatswain or the like how can thei he said when thei ar not allow to appli their mind to the call of ani of these nor mai thei imit the neigh of hors the bellow of bull the murmur of river and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing nai he said if mad be forbidden neither mai thei copi the behaviour of madmen you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is on sort of narr style which mai be emploi by a truli good man when he ha anyth to sai and that anoth sort will be us by a man of an opposit charact and educ and which ar these two sort he ask suppos i answer that a just and good man in the cours of a narrat come on some sai or action of anoth good mani should imagin that he will like to person him and will not be asham of thi sort of imit he will be most readi to plai the part of the good man when he is act firmli and wise in a less degre when he is overtaken by ill or love or drink or ha met with ani other disast but when he come to a charact which is unworthi of him he will not make a studi of that he will disdain such a person and will assum hi like if at all for a moment onli when he is perform some good action at other time he will be asham to plai a part which he ha never practis nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser model he feel the employ of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and hi mind revolt at it so i should expect he repli then he will adopt a mode of narrat such as we have illustr out of homer that is to sai hi style will be both imit and narr but there will be veri littl of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agre certainli he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarili take but there is anoth sort of charact who will narrat anyth and the wors he is the more unscrupul he will be noth will be too bad for him and he will be readi to imit anyth not as a joke but in right good earnest and befor a larg compani as i wa just now sai he will attempt to repres the roll of thunder the nois of wind and hail or the creak of wheel and pullei and the variou sound of flute pipe trumpet and all sort of instrument he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock hi entir art will consist in imit of voic and gestur and there will be veri littl narrat that he said will be hi mode of speak these then ar the two kind of style ye and you would agre with me in sai that on of them is simpl and ha but slight chang and if the harmoni and rhythm ar also chosen for their simplic the result is that the speaker if he speak correctli is alwai pretti much the same in style and he will keep within the limit of a singl harmoni for the chang ar not great and in like manner he will make us of nearli the same rhythm that is quit true he said wherea the other requir all sort of harmoni and all sort of rhythm if the music and the style ar to correspond becaus the style ha all sort of chang that is also perfectli true he repli and do not the two style or the mixtur of the two comprehend all poetri and everi form of express in word no on can sai anyth except in on or other of them or in both togeth thei includ all he said and shall we receiv into our state all the three style or on onli of the two unmix style or would you includ the mix i should prefer onli to admit the pure imit of virtu ye i said adeimantu but the mix style is also veri charm and inde the pantomim which is the opposit of the on chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attend and with the world in gener i do not deni it but i suppos you would argu that such a style is unsuit to our state in which human natur is not twofold or manifold for on man plai on part onli ye quit unsuit and thi is the reason why in our state and in our state onli we shall find a shoemak to be a shoemak and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout true he said and therefor when ani on of these pantomim gentlemen who ar so clever that thei can imit anyth come to us and make a propos to exhibit himself and hi poetri we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holi and wonder be but we must also inform him that in our state such as he ar not permit to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anoint him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon hi head we shall send him awai to anoth citi for we mean to emploi for our soul health the rougher and sever poet or storytel who will imit the style of the virtuou onli and will follow those model which we prescrib at first when we began the educ of our soldier we certainli will he said if we have the power then now my friend i said that part of music or literari educ which relat to the stori or myth mai be consid to be finish for the matter and manner have both been discuss i think so too he said next in order will follow melodi and song that is obviou everi on can see alreadi what we ought to sai about them if we ar to be consist with ourselv i fear said glaucon laugh that the word everi on hardli includ me for i cannot at the moment sai what thei should be though i mai guess at ani rate you can tell that a song or od ha three partsth word the melodi and the rhythm that degre of knowledg i mai presuppos ye he said so much as that you mai and as for the word there will sure be no differ between word which ar and which ar not set to music both will conform to the same law and these have been alreadi determin by us ye and the melodi and rhythm will depend upon the word certainli we were sai when we spoke of the subjectmatt that we had no need of lament and strain of sorrow true and which ar the harmoni express of sorrow you ar music and can tell me the harmoni which you mean ar the mix or tenor lydian and the fullton or bass lydian and such like these then i said must be banish even to women who have a charact to maintain thei ar of no us and much less to men certainli in the next place drunken and soft and indol ar utterli unbecom the charact of our guardian utterli unbecom and which ar the soft or drink harmoni the ionian he repli and the lydian thei ar term relax well and ar these of ani militari us quit the revers he repli and if so the dorian and the phrygian ar the onli on which you have left i answer of the harmoni i know noth but i want to have on warlik to sound the note or accent which a brave man utter in the hour of danger and stern resolv or when hi caus is fail and he is go to wound or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at everi such crisi meet the blow of fortun with firm step and a determin to endur and anoth to be us by him in time of peac and freedom of action when there is no pressur of necess and he is seek to persuad god by prayer or man by instruct and admonit or on the other hand when he is express hi willing to yield to persuas or entreati or admonit and which repres him when by prudent conduct he ha attain hi end not carri awai by hi success but act moder and wise under the circumst and acquiesc in the event these two harmoni i ask you to leav the strain of necess and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortun and the strain of the fortun the strain of courag and the strain of temper these i sai leav and these he repli ar the dorian and phrygian harmoni of which i wa just now speak then i said if these and these onli ar to be us in our song and melodi we shall not want multipl of note or a panharmon scale i suppos not then we shall not maintain the artific of lyre with three corner and complex scale or the maker of ani other manystring curiouslyharmonis instrument certainli not but what do you sai to flutemak and fluteplay would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in thi composit us of harmoni the flute is wors than all the string instrument put togeth even the panharmon music is onli an imit of the flute clearli not there remain then onli the lyre and the harp for us in the citi and the shepherd mai have a pipe in the countri that is sure the conclus to be drawn from the argument the prefer of apollo and hi instrument to marsya and hi instrument is not at all strang i said not at all he repli and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsci purg the state which not long ago we term luxuri and we have done wise he repli then let us now finish the purgat i said next in order to harmoni rhythm will natur follow and thei should be subject to the same rule for we ought not to seek out complex system of metr or metr of everi kind but rather to discov what rhythm ar the express of a courag and harmoni life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melodi to word have a like spirit not the word to the foot and melodi to sai what these rhythm ar will be your dutyy must teach me them as you have alreadi taught me the harmoni but inde he repli i cannot tell you i onli know that there ar some three principl of rhythm out of which metric system ar frame just as in sound there ar four note ie the four note of the tetrachord out of which all the harmoni ar compos that is an observ which i have made but of what sort of live thei ar sever the imit i am unabl to sai then i said we must take damon into our counsel and he will tell us what rhythm ar express of mean or insol or furi or other unworthi and what ar to be reserv for the express of opposit feel and i think that i have an indistinct recollect of hi mention a complex cretic rhythm also a dactyl or heroic and he arrang them in some manner which i do not quit understand make the rhythm equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short altern and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assign to them short and long quantiti also in some case he appear to prais or censur the movement of the foot quit as much as the rhythm or perhap a combin of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matter howev as i wa sai had better be refer to damon himself for the analysi of the subject would be difficult you know socrat express himself carelessli in accord with hi assum ignor of the detail of the subject in the first part of the sentenc he appear to be speak of paeonic rhythm which ar in the ratio of in the second part of dactyl and anapaest rhythm which ar in the ratio of in the last claus of iambic and trochaic rhythm which ar in the ratio of or rather so i should sai but there is no difficulti in see that grace or the absenc of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm none at all and also that good and bad rhythm natur assimil to a good and bad style and that harmoni and discord in like manner follow style for our principl is that rhythm and harmoni ar regul by the word and not the word by them just so he said thei should follow the word and will not the word and the charact of the style depend on the temper of the soul ye and everyth els on the style ye then beauti of style and harmoni and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicityi mean the true simplic of a rightli and nobli order mind and charact not that other simplic which is onli an euphem for folli veri true he repli and if our youth ar to do their work in life must thei not make these grace and harmoni their perpetu aim thei must and sure the art of the painter and everi other creativ and construct art ar full of themweav embroideri architectur and everi kind of manufactur also natur anim and vegetablein all of them there is grace or the absenc of grace and ugli and discord and inharmoni motion ar nearli alli to ill word and ill natur as grace and harmoni ar the twin sister of good and virtu and bear their like that is quit true he said but shall our superintend go no further and ar the poet onli to be requir by us to express the imag of the good in their work on pain if thei do anyth els of expuls from our state or is the same control to be extend to other artist and ar thei also to be prohibit from exhibit the opposit form of vice and intemper and mean and indec in sculptur and build and the other creativ art and is he who cannot conform to thi rule of our to be prevent from practis hi art in our state lest the tast of our citizen be corrupt by him we would not have our guardian grow up amid imag of moral deform as in some noxiou pastur and there brows and feed upon mani a bane herb and flower dai by dai littl by littl until thei silent gather a fester mass of corrupt in their own soul let our artist rather be those who ar gift to discern the true natur of the beauti and grace then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sight and sound and receiv the good in everyth and beauti the effluenc of fair work shall flow into the ey and ear like a healthgiv breez from a purer region and insens draw the soul from earliest year into like and sympathi with the beauti of reason there can be no nobler train than that he repli and therefor i said glaucon music train is a more potent instrument than ani other becaus rhythm and harmoni find their wai into the inward place of the soul on which thei mightili fasten impart grace and make the soul of him who is rightli educ grace or of him who is illeduc ungrac and also becaus he who ha receiv thi true educ of the inner be will most shrewdli perceiv omiss or fault in art and natur and with a true tast while he prais and rejoic over and receiv into hi soul the good and becom nobl and good he will justli blame and hate the bad now in the dai of hi youth even befor he is abl to know the reason why and when reason come he will recognis and salut the friend with whom hi educ ha made him long familiar ye he said i quit agre with you in think that our youth should be train in music and on the ground which you mention just as in learn to read i said we were satisfi when we knew the letter of the alphabet which ar veri few in all their recur size and combin not slight them as unimport whether thei occupi a space larg or small but everywher eager to make them out and not think ourselv perfect in the art of read until we recognis them wherev thei ar found true or as we recognis the reflect of letter in the water or in a mirror onli when we know the letter themselv the same art and studi give us the knowledg of both exactli even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardian whom we have to educ can ever becom music until we and thei know the essenti form of temper courag liber magnific and their kindr as well as the contrari form in all their combin and can recognis them and their imag wherev thei ar found not slight them either in small thing or great but believ them all to be within the sphere of on art and studi most assuredli and when a beauti soul harmon with a beauti form and the two ar cast in on mould that will be the fairest of sight to him who ha an ey to see it the fairest inde and the fairest is also the loveliest that mai be assum and the man who ha the spirit of harmoni will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmoni soul that is true he repli if the defici be in hi soul but if there be ani mere bodili defect in anoth he will be patient of it and will love all the same i perceiv i said that you have or have had experi of thi sort and i agre but let me ask you anoth question ha excess of pleasur ani affin to temper how can that be he repli pleasur depriv a man of the us of hi faculti quit as much as pain or ani affin to virtu in gener none whatev ani affin to wanton and intemper ye the greatest and is there ani greater or keener pleasur than that of sensual love no nor a madder wherea true love is a love of beauti and ordertemper and harmoni quit true he said then no intemper or mad should be allow to approach true love certainli not then mad or intemper pleasur must never be allow to come near the lover and hi belov neither of them can have ani part in it if their love is of the right sort no inde socrat it must never come near them then i suppos that in the citi which we ar found you would make a law to the effect that a friend should us no other familiar to hi love than a father would us to hi son and then onli for a nobl purpos and he must first have the other consent and thi rule is to limit him in all hi intercours and he is never to be seen go further or if he exce he is to be deem guilti of coars and bad tast i quit agre he said thu much of music which make a fair end for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauti i agre he said after music come gymnast in which our youth ar next to be train certainli gymnast as well as music should begin in earli year the train in it should be care and should continu through life now my belief isand thi is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirm of my own but my own belief isnot that the good bodi by ani bodili excel improv the soul but on the contrari that the good soul by her own excel improv the bodi as far as thi mai be possibl what do you sai ye i agre then to the mind when adequ train we shall be right in hand over the more particular care of the bodi and in order to avoid prolix we will now onli give the gener outlin of the subject veri good that thei must abstain from intox ha been alreadi remark by us for of all person a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is ye he said that a guardian should requir anoth guardian to take care of him is ridicul inde but next what shall we sai of their food for the men ar in train for the great contest of allar thei not ye he said and will the habit of bodi of our ordinari athlet be suit to them why not i am afraid i said that a habit of bodi such as thei have is but a sleepi sort of thing and rather peril to health do you not observ that these athlet sleep awai their live and ar liabl to most danger ill if thei depart in ever so slight a degre from their customari regimen ye i do then i said a finer sort of train will be requir for our warrior athlet who ar to be like wake dog and to see and hear with the utmost keen amid the mani chang of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which thei will have to endur when on a campaign thei must not be liabl to break down in health that is my view the realli excel gymnast is twin sister of that simpl music which we were just now describ how so why i conceiv that there is a gymnast which like our music is simpl and good and especi the militari gymnast what do you mean my mean mai be learn from homer he you know feed hi hero at their feast when thei ar campaign on soldier fare thei have no fish although thei ar on the shore of the hellespont and thei ar not allow boil meat but onli roast which is the food most conveni for soldier requir onli that thei should light a fire and not involv the troubl of carri about pot and pan true and i can hardli be mistaken in sai that sweet sauc ar nowher mention in homer in proscrib them howev he is not singular all profession athlet ar well awar that a man who is to be in good condit should take noth of the kind ye he said and know thi thei ar quit right in not take them then you would not approv of syracusan dinner and the refin of sicilian cookeri i think not nor if a man is to be in condit would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as hi fair friend certainli not neither would you approv of the delicaci as thei ar thought of athenian confectionari certainli not all such feed and live mai be rightli compar by us to melodi and song compos in the panharmon style and in all the rhythm exactli there complex engend licenc and here diseas wherea simplic in music wa the parent of temper in the soul and simplic in gymnast of health in the bodi most true he said but when intemper and diseas multipli in a state hall of justic and medicin ar alwai be open and the art of the doctor and the lawyer give themselv air find how keen is the interest which not onli the slave but the freemen of a citi take about them of cours and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgrac state of educ than thi that not onli artisan and the meaner sort of peopl need the skill of firstrat physician and judg but also those who would profess to have had a liber educ is it not disgrac and a great sign of want of goodbreed that a man should have to go abroad for hi law and physic becaus he ha none of hi own at home and must therefor surrend himself into the hand of other men whom he make lord and judg over him of all thing he said the most disgrac would you sai most i repli when you consid that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not onli a lifelong litig pass all hi dai in the court either as plaintiff or defend but is actual led by hi bad tast to pride himself on hi litigi he imagin that he is a master in dishonesti abl to take everi crook turn and wriggl into and out of everi hole bend like a withi and get out of the wai of justic and all for whatin order to gain small point not worth mention he not know that so to order hi life as to be abl to do without a nap judg is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgrac ye he said that is still more disgrac well i said and to requir the help of medicin not when a wound ha to be cure or on occas of an epidem but just becaus by indol and a habit of life such as we have been describ men fill themselv with water and wind as if their bodi were a marsh compel the ingeni son of asclepiu to find more name for diseas such as flatul and catarrh is not thi too a disgrac ye he said thei do certainli give veri strang and newfangl name to diseas ye i said and i do not believ that there were ani such diseas in the dai of asclepiu and thi i infer from the circumst that the hero eurypylu after he ha been wound in homer drink a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkl with barleym and grate chees which ar certainli inflammatori and yet the son of asclepiu who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who give him the drink or rebuk patroclu who is treat hi case well he said that wa sure an extraordinari drink to be given to a person in hi condit not so extraordinari i repli if you bear in mind that in former dai as is commonli said befor the time of herodicu the guild of asclepiu did not practis our present system of medicin which mai be said to educ diseas but herodicu be a trainer and himself of a sickli constitut by a combin of train and doctor found out a wai of tortur first and chiefli himself and secondli the rest of the world how wa that he said by the invent of linger death for he had a mortal diseas which he perpetu tend and as recoveri wa out of the question he pass hi entir life as a valetudinarian he could do noth but attend upon himself and he wa in constant torment whenev he depart in anyth from hi usual regimen and so dy hard by the help of scienc he struggl on to old ag a rare reward of hi skill ye i said a reward which a man might fairli expect who never understood that if asclepiu did not instruct hi descend in valetudinarian art the omiss aros not from ignor or inexperi of such a branch of medicin but becaus he knew that in all wellord state everi individu ha an occup to which he must attend and ha therefor no leisur to spend in continu be ill thi we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicr enough do not appli the same rule to peopl of the richer sort how do you mean he said i mean thi when a carpent is ill he ask the physician for a rough and readi cure an emet or a purg or a cauteri or the knifethes ar hi remedi and if some on prescrib for him a cours of dietet and tell him that he must swath and swaddl hi head and all that sort of thing he repli at onc that he ha no time to be ill and that he see no good in a life which is spent in nurs hi diseas to the neglect of hi customari employ and therefor bid goodby to thi sort of physician he resum hi ordinari habit and either get well and live and doe hi busi or if hi constitut fail he di and ha no more troubl ye he said and a man in hi condit of life ought to us the art of medicin thu far onli ha he not i said an occup and what profit would there be in hi life if he were depriv of hi occup quit true he said but with the rich man thi is otherwis of him we do not sai that he ha ani special appoint work which he must perform if he would live he is gener suppos to have noth to do then you never heard of the sai of phocylid that as soon as a man ha a livelihood he should practis virtu nai he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner let us not have a disput with him about thi i said but rather ask ourselv is the practic of virtu obligatori on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatori on him then let us rais a further question whether thi diet of disord which is an impedi to the applic of the mind in carpent and the mechan art doe not equal stand in the wai of the sentiment of phocylid of that he repli there can be no doubt such excess care of the bodi when carri beyond the rule of gymnast is most inim to the practic of virtu ye inde i repli and equal incompat with the manag of a hous an armi or an offic of state and what is most import of all irreconcil with ani kind of studi or thought or selfreflectionther is a constant suspicion that headach and giddi ar to be ascrib to philosophi and henc all practis or make trial of virtu in the higher sens is absolut stop for a man is alwai fanci that he is be made ill and is in constant anxieti about the state of hi bodi ye like enough and therefor our polit asclepiu mai be suppos to have exhibit the power of hi art onli to person who be gener of healthi constitut and habit of life had a definit ailment such as these he cure by purg and oper and bade them live as usual herein consult the interest of the state but bodi which diseas had penetr through and through he would not have attempt to cure by gradual process of evacu and infus he did not want to lengthen out goodfornoth live or to have weak father beget weaker sonsif a man wa not abl to live in the ordinari wai he had no busi to cure him for such a cure would have been of no us either to himself or to the state then he said you regard asclepiu as a statesman clearli and hi charact is further illustr by hi son note that thei were hero in the dai of old and practis the medicin of which i am speak at the sieg of troi you will rememb how when pandaru wound menelau thei suck the blood out of the wound and sprinkl sooth remedi but thei never prescrib what the patient wa afterward to eat or drink in the case of menelau ani more than in the case of eurypylu the remedi as thei conceiv were enough to heal ani man who befor he wa wound wa healthi and regular in hi habit and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but thei would have noth to do with unhealthi and intemper subject whose live were of no us either to themselv or other the art of medicin wa not design for their good and though thei were as rich as mida the son of asclepiu would have declin to attend them thei were veri acut person those son of asclepiu natur so i repli nevertheless the tragedian and pindar disobei our behest although thei acknowledg that asclepiu wa the son of apollo sai also that he wa bribe into heal a rich man who wa at the point of death and for thi reason he wa struck by lightn but we in accord with the principl alreadi affirm by us will not believ them when thei tell us bothif he wa the son of a god we maintain that he wa not avarici or if he wa avarici he wa not the son of a god all that socrat is excel but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physician in a state and ar not the best those who have treat the greatest number of constitut good and bad and ar not the best judg in like manner those who ar acquaint with all sort of moral natur ye i said i too would have good judg and good physician but do you know whom i think good will you tell me i will if i can let me howev note that in the same question you join two thing which ar not the same how so he ask why i said you join physician and judg now the most skil physician ar those who from their youth upward have combin with the knowledg of their art the greatest experi of diseas thei had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseas in their own person for the bodi as i conceiv is not the instrument with which thei cure the bodi in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickli but thei cure the bodi with the mind and the mind which ha becom and is sick can cure noth that is veri true he said but with the judg it is otherwis sinc he govern mind by mind he ought not therefor to have been train among viciou mind and to have associ with them from youth upward and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime onli in order that he mai quickli infer the crime of other as he might their bodili diseas from hi own selfconsci the honour mind which is to form a healthi judgment should have had no experi or contamin of evil habit when young and thi is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simpl and ar easili practis upon by the dishonest becaus thei have no exampl of what evil is in their own soul ye he said thei ar far too apt to be deceiv therefor i said the judg should not be young he should have learn to know evil not from hi own soul but from late and long observ of the natur of evil in other knowledg should be hi guid not person experi ye he said that is the ideal of a judg ye i repli and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who ha a good soul but the cun and suspici natur of which we spokeh who ha commit mani crime and fanci himself to be a master in wicked when he is amongst hi fellow is wonder in the precaut which he take becaus he judg of them by himself but when he get into the compani of men of virtu who have the experi of ag he appear to be a fool again ow to hi unseason suspicion he cannot recognis an honest man becaus he ha no pattern of honesti in himself at the same time as the bad ar more numer than the good and he meet with them often he think himself and is by other thought to be rather wise than foolish most true he said then the good and wise judg whom we ar seek is not thi man but the other for vice cannot know virtu too but a virtuou natur educ by time will acquir a knowledg both of virtu and vice the virtuou and not the viciou man ha wisdomin my opinion and in mine also thi is the sort of medicin and thi is the sort of law which you will sanction in your state thei will minist to better natur give health both of soul and of bodi but those who ar diseas in their bodi thei will leav to die and the corrupt and incur soul thei will put an end to themselv that is clearli the best thing both for the patient and for the state and thu our youth have been educ onli in that simpl music which as we said inspir temper will be reluct to go to law clearli and the musician who keep to the same track is content to practis the simpl gymnast will have noth to do with medicin unless in some extrem case that i quit believ the veri exercis and toll which he undergo ar intend to stimul the spirit element of hi natur and not to increas hi strength he will not like common athlet us exercis and regimen to develop hi muscl veri right he said neither ar the two art of music and gymnast realli design as is often suppos the on for the train of the soul the other for the train of the bodi what then is the real object of them i believ i said that the teacher of both have in view chiefli the improv of the soul how can that be he ask did you never observ i said the effect on the mind itself of exclus devot to gymnast or the opposit effect of an exclus devot to music in what wai shown he said the on produc a temper of hard and feroc the other of soft and effeminaci i repli ye he said i am quit awar that the mere athlet becom too much of a savag and that the mere musician is melt and soften beyond what is good for him yet sure i said thi feroc onli come from spirit which if rightli educ would give courag but if too much intensifi is liabl to becom hard and brutal that i quit think on the other hand the philosoph will have the qualiti of gentl and thi also when too much indulg will turn to soft but if educ rightli will be gentl and moder true and in our opinion the guardian ought to have both these qualiti assuredli and both should be in harmoni beyond question and the harmoni soul is both temper and courag ye and the inharmoni is cowardli and boorish veri true and when a man allow music to plai upon him and to pour into hi soul through the funnel of hi ear those sweet and soft and melancholi air of which we were just now speak and hi whole life is pass in warbl and the delight of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is temper like iron and made us instead of brittl and useless but if he carri on the soften and sooth process in the next stage he begin to melt and wast until he ha wast awai hi spirit and cut out the sinew of hi soul and he becom a feebl warrior veri true if the element of spirit is natur weak in him the chang is speedili accomplish but if he have a good deal then the power of music weaken the spirit render him excitableon the least provoc he flame up at onc and is speedili extinguish instead of have spirit he grow irrit and passion and is quit impractic exactli and so in gymnast if a man take violent exercis and is a great feeder and the revers of a great student of music and philosophi at first the high condit of hi bodi fill him with pride and spirit and he becom twice the man that he wa certainli and what happen if he do noth els and hold no convers with the muse doe not even that intellig which there mai be in him have no tast of ani sort of learn or enquiri or thought or cultur grow feebl and dull and blind hi mind never wake up or receiv nourish and hi sens not be purg of their mist true he said and he end by becom a hater of philosophi uncivil never us the weapon of persuasionh is like a wild beast all violenc and fierc and know no other wai of deal and he live in all ignor and evil condit and ha no sens of proprieti and grace that is quit true he said and as there ar two principl of human natur on the spirit and the other the philosoph some god as i should sai ha given mankind two art answer to them and onli indirectli to the soul and bodi in order that these two principl like the string of an instrument mai be relax or drawn tighter until thei ar duli harmon that appear to be the intent and he who mingl music with gymnast in the fairest proport and best attemp them to the soul mai be rightli call the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sens than the tuner of the string you ar quit right socrat and such a presid geniu will be alwai requir in our state if the govern is to last ye he will be absolut necessari such then ar our principl of nurtur and educ where would be the us of go into further detail about the danc of our citizen or about their hunt and cours their gymnast and equestrian contest for these all follow the gener principl and have found that we shall have no difficulti in discov them i dare sai that there will be no difficulti veri good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who ar to be ruler and who subject certainli there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger clearli and that the best of these must rule that is also clear now ar not the best husbandmen those who ar most devot to husbandri ye and as we ar to have the best of guardian for our citi must thei not be those who have most the charact of guardian ye and to thi end thei ought to be wise and effici and to have a special care of the state true and a man will be most like to care about that which he love to be sure and he will be most like to love that which he regard as have the same interest with himself and that of which the good or evil fortun is suppos by him at ani time most to affect hi own veri true he repli then there must be a select let us note among the guardian those who in their whole life show the greatest eager to do what is for the good of their countri and the greatest repugn to do what is against her interest those ar the right men and thei will have to be watch at everi ag in order that we mai see whether thei preserv their resolut and never under the influenc either of forc or enchant forget or cast off their sens of duti to the state how cast off he said i will explain to you i repli a resolut mai go out of a man mind either with hi will or against hi will with hi will when he get rid of a falsehood and learn better against hi will whenev he is depriv of a truth i understand he said the will loss of a resolut the mean of the unwil i have yet to learn why i said do you not see that men ar unwillingli depriv of good and willingli of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agre that to conceiv thing as thei ar is to possess the truth ye he repli i agre with you in think that mankind ar depriv of truth against their will and is not thi involuntari depriv caus either by theft or forc or enchant still he repli i do not understand you i fear that i must have been talk darkli like the tragedian i onli mean that some men ar chang by persuas and that other forget argument steal awai the heart of on class and time of the other and thi i call theft now you understand me ye those again who ar forc ar those whom the violenc of some pain or grief compel to chang their opinion i understand he said and you ar quit right and you would also acknowledg that the enchant ar those who chang their mind either under the softer influenc of pleasur or the sterner influenc of fear ye he said everyth that deceiv mai be said to enchant therefor as i wa just now sai we must enquir who ar the best guardian of their own convict that what thei think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their live we must watch them from their youth upward and make them perform action in which thei ar most like to forget or to be deceiv and he who rememb and is not deceiv is to be select and he who fail in the trial is to be reject that will be the wai ye and there should also be toil and pain and conflict prescrib for them in which thei will be made to give further proof of the same qualiti veri right he repli and then i said we must try them with enchantmentsthat is the third sort of testand see what will be their behaviour like those who take colt amid nois and tumult to see if thei ar of a timid natur so must we take our youth amid terror of some kind and again pass them into pleasur and prove them more thoroughli than gold is prove in the furnac that we mai discov whether thei ar arm against all enchant and of a nobl bear alwai good guardian of themselv and of the music which thei have learn and retain under all circumst a rhythmic and harmoni natur such as will be most servic to the individu and to the state and he who at everi ag as boi and youth and in matur life ha come out of the trial victori and pure shall be appoint a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honour in life and death and shall receiv sepultur and other memori of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fail we must reject i am inclin to think that thi is the sort of wai in which our ruler and guardian should be chosen and appoint i speak gener and not with ani pretens to exact and speak gener i agre with you he said and perhap the word guardian in the fullest sens ought to be appli to thi higher class onli who preserv us against foreign enemi and maintain peac among our citizen at home that the on mai not have the will or the other the power to harm us the young men whom we befor call guardian mai be more properli design auxiliari and support of the principl of the ruler i agre with you he said how then mai we devis on of those need falsehood of which we late spokejust on royal lie which mai deceiv the ruler if that be possibl and at ani rate the rest of the citi what sort of lie he said noth new i repli onli an old phoenician tale law of what ha often occur befor now in other place as the poet sai and have made the world believ though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probabl if it did how your word seem to hesit on your lip you will not wonder i repli at my hesit when you have heard speak he said and fear not well then i will speak although i realli know not how to look you in the face or in what word to utter the audaci fiction which i propos to commun gradual first to the ruler then to the soldier and lastli to the peopl thei ar to be told that their youth wa a dream and the educ and train which thei receiv from us an appear onli in realiti dure all that time thei were be form and fed in the womb of the earth where thei themselv and their arm and appurten were manufactur when thei were complet the earth their mother sent them up and so their countri be their mother and also their nurs thei ar bound to advis for her good and to defend her against attack and her citizen thei ar to regard as children of the earth and their own brother you had good reason he said to be asham of the lie which you were go to tell true i repli but there is more come i have onli told you half citizen we shall sai to them in our tale you ar brother yet god ha frame you differ some of you have the power of command and in the composit of these he ha mingl gold wherefor also thei have the greatest honour other he ha made of silver to be auxiliari other again who ar to be husbandmen and craftsmen he ha compos of brass and iron and the speci will gener be preserv in the children but as all ar of the same origin stock a golden parent will sometim have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaim as a first principl to the ruler and abov all els that there is noth which thei should so anxious guard or of which thei ar to be such good guardian as of the puriti of the race thei should observ what element mingl in their offspr for if the son of a golden or silver parent ha an admixtur of brass and iron then natur order a transposit of rank and the ey of the ruler must not be piti toward the child becaus he ha to descend in the scale and becom a husbandman or artisan just as there mai be son of artisan who have an admixtur of gold or silver in them ar rais to honour and becom guardian or auxiliari for an oracl sai that when a man of brass or iron guard the state it will be destroi such is the tale is there ani possibl of make our citizen believ in it not in the present gener he repli there is no wai of accomplish thi but their son mai be made to believ in the tale and their son son and poster after them i see the difficulti i repli yet the foster of such a belief will make them care more for the citi and for on anoth enough howev of the fiction which mai now fly abroad upon the wing of rumour while we arm our earthborn hero and lead them forth under the command of their ruler let them look round and select a spot whenc thei can best suppress insurrect if ani prove refractori within and also defend themselv against enemi who like wolv mai come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when thei have encamp let them sacrific to the proper god and prepar their dwell just so he said and their dwell must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer i suppos that you mean hous he repli ye i said but thei must be the hous of soldier and not of shopkeep what is the differ he said that i will endeavour to explain i repli to keep watchdog who from want of disciplin or hunger or some evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worri them and behav not like dog but wolv would be a foul and monstrou thing in a shepherd truli monstrou he said and therefor everi care must be taken that our auxiliari be stronger than our citizen mai not grow to be too much for them and becom savag tyrant instead of friend and alli ye great care should be taken and would not a realli good educ furnish the best safeguard but thei ar welleduc alreadi he repli i cannot be so confid my dear glaucon i said i am much more certain that thei ought to be and that true educ whatev that mai be will have the greatest tendenc to civil and human them in their relat to on anoth and to those who ar under their protect veri true he repli and not onli their educ but their habit and all that belong to them should be such as will neither impair their virtu as guardian nor tempt them to prei upon the other citizen ani man of sens must acknowledg that he must then now let us consid what will be their wai of life if thei ar to realiz our idea of them in the first place none of them should have ani properti of hi own beyond what is absolut necessari neither should thei have a privat hous or store close against ani on who ha a mind to enter their provis should be onli such as ar requir by train warrior who ar men of temper and courag thei should agre to receiv from the citizen a fix rate of pai enough to meet the expens of the year and no more and thei will go to mess and live togeth like soldier in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that thei have from god the divin metal is within them and thei have therefor no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollut the divin by ani such earthli admixtur for that common metal ha been the sourc of mani unholi deed but their own is undefil and thei alon of all the citizen mai not touch or handl silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and thi will be their salvat and thei will be the saviour of the state but should thei ever acquir home or land or monei of their own thei will becom housekeep and husbandmen instead of guardian enemi and tyrant instead of alli of the other citizen hate and be hate plot and be plot against thei will pass their whole life in much greater terror of intern than of extern enemi and the hour of ruin both to themselv and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reason mai we not sai that thu shall our state be order and that these shall be the regul appoint by us for guardian concern their hous and all other matter ye said glaucon book iv here adeimantu interpos a question how would you answer socrat said he if a person were to sai that you ar make these peopl miser and that thei ar the caus of their own unhappi the citi in fact belong to them but thei ar none the better for it wherea other men acquir land and build larg and handsom hous and have everyth handsom about them offer sacrific to the god on their own account and practis hospit moreov as you were sai just now thei have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourit of fortun but our poor citizen ar no better than mercenari who ar quarter in the citi and ar alwai mount guard ye i said and you mai add that thei ar onli fed and not paid in addit to their food like other men and therefor thei cannot if thei would take a journei of pleasur thei have no monei to spend on a mistress or ani other luxuri fanci which as the world goe is thought to be happi and mani other accus of the same natur might be ad but said he let us suppos all thi to be includ in the charg you mean to ask i said what will be our answer ye if we proce along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer and our answer will be that even as thei ar our guardian mai veri like be the happiest of men but that our aim in found the state wa not the disproportion happi of ani on class but the greatest happi of the whole we thought that in a state which is order with a view to the good of the whole we should be most like to find justic and in the illord state injustic and have found them we might then decid which of the two is the happier at present i take it we ar fashion the happi state not piecem or with a view of make a few happi citizen but as a whole and byandbi we will proce to view the opposit kind of state suppos that we were paint a statu and some on came up to us and said why do you not put the most beauti colour on the most beauti part of the bodyth ey ought to be purpl but you have made them blackto him we might fairli answer sir you would not sure have us beautifi the ey to such a degre that thei ar no longer ey consid rather whether by give thi and the other featur their due proport we make the whole beauti and so i sai to you do not compel us to assign to the guardian a sort of happi which will make them anyth but guardian for we too can cloth our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crown of gold on their head and bid them till the ground as much as thei like and no more our potter also might be allow to repos on couch and feast by the firesid pass round the winecup while their wheel is conveni at hand and work at potteri onli as much as thei like in thi wai we might make everi class happyand then as you imagin the whole state would be happi but do not put thi idea into our head for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will ceas to be a potter and no on will have the charact of ani distinct class in the state now thi is not of much consequ where the corrupt of societi and pretens to be what you ar not is confin to cobbler but when the guardian of the law and of the govern ar onli seem and not real guardian then see how thei turn the state upsid down and on the other hand thei alon have the power of give order and happi to the state we mean our guardian to be true saviour and not the destroy of the state wherea our oppon is think of peasant at a festiv who ar enjoi a life of revelri not of citizen who ar do their duti to the state but if so we mean differ thing and he is speak of someth which is not a state and therefor we must consid whether in appoint our guardian we would look to their greatest happi individu or whether thi principl of happi doe not rather resid in the state as a whole but if the latter be the truth then the guardian and auxiliari and all other equal with them must be compel or induc to do their own work in the best wai and thu the whole state will grow up in a nobl order and the sever class will receiv the proport of happi which natur assign to them i think that you ar quit right i wonder whether you will agre with anoth remark which occur to me what mai that be there seem to be two caus of the deterior of the art what ar thei wealth i said and poverti how do thei act the process is as follow when a potter becom rich will he think you ani longer take the same pain with hi art certainli not he will grow more and more indol and careless veri true and the result will be that he becom a wors potter ye he greatli deterior but on the other hand if he ha no monei and cannot provid himself with tool or instrument he will not work equal well himself nor will he teach hi son or apprentic to work equal well certainli not then under the influenc either of poverti or of wealth workmen and their work ar equal liabl to degener that is evid here then is a discoveri of new evil i said against which the guardian will have to watch or thei will creep into the citi unobserv what evil wealth i said and poverti the on is the parent of luxuri and indol and the other of mean and vicious and both of discont that is veri true he repli but still i should like to know socrat how our citi will be abl to go to war especi against an enemi who is rich and power if depriv of the sinew of war there would certainli be a difficulti i repli in go to war with on such enemi but there is no difficulti where there ar two of them how so he ask in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be train warrior fight against an armi of rich men that is true he said and do you not suppos adeimantu that a singl boxer who wa perfect in hi art would easili be a match for two stout and welltodo gentlemen who were not boxer hardli if thei came upon him at onc what now i said if he were abl to run awai and then turn and strike at the on who first came up and suppos he were to do thi sever time under the heat of a scorch sun might he not be an expert overturn more than on stout personag certainli he said there would be noth wonder in that and yet rich men probabl have a greater superior in the scienc and practis of box than thei have in militari qualiti like enough then we mai assum that our athlet will be abl to fight with two or three time their own number i agre with you for i think you right and suppos that befor engag our citizen send an embassi to on of the two citi tell them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor ar permit to have but you mai do you therefor come and help us in war and take the spoil of the other citi who on hear these word would choos to fight against lean wiri dog rather than with the dog on their side against fat and tender sheep that is not like and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of mani state were to be gather into on but how simpl of you to us the term state at all of ani but our own why so you ought to speak of other state in the plural number not on of them is a citi but mani citi as thei sai in the game for inde ani citi howev small is in fact divid into two on the citi of the poor the other of the rich these ar at war with on anoth and in either there ar mani smaller divis and you would be altogeth besid the mark if you treat them all as a singl state but if you deal with them as mani and give the wealth or power or person of the on to the other you will alwai have a great mani friend and not mani enemi and your state while the wise order which ha now been prescrib continu to prevail in her will be the greatest of state i do not mean to sai in reput or appear but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defend a singl state which is her equal you will hardli find either among hellen or barbarian though mani that appear to be as great and mani time greater that is most true he said and what i said will be the best limit for our ruler to fix when thei ar consid the size of the state and the amount of territori which thei ar to includ and beyond which thei will not go what limit would you propos i would allow the state to increas so far as is consist with uniti that i think is the proper limit veri good he said here then i said is anoth order which will have to be convei to our guardian let our citi be account neither larg nor small but on and selfsuff and sure said he thi is not a veri sever order which we impos upon them and the other said i of which we were speak befor is lighter stilli mean the duti of degrad the offspr of the guardian when inferior and of elev into the rank of guardian the offspr of the lower class when natur superior the intent wa that in the case of the citizen gener each individu should be put to the us for which natur intend him on to on work and then everi man would do hi own busi and be on and not mani and so the whole citi would be on and not mani ye he said that is not so difficult the regul which we ar prescrib my good adeimantu ar not as might be suppos a number of great principl but trifl all if care be taken as the sai is of the on great thinga thing howev which i would rather call not great but suffici for our purpos what mai that be he ask educ i said and nurtur if our citizen ar well educ and grow into sensibl men thei will easili see their wai through all these as well as other matter which i omit such for exampl as marriag the possess of women and the procreat of children which will all follow the gener principl that friend have all thing in common as the proverb sai that will be the best wai of settl them also i said the state if onc start well move with accumul forc like a wheel for good nurtur and educ implant good constitut and these good constitut take root in a good educ improv more and more and thi improv affect the breed in man as in other anim veri possibl he said then to sum up thi is the point to which abov all the attent of our ruler should be directedthat music and gymnast be preserv in their origin form and no innov made thei must do their utmost to maintain them intact and when ani on sai that mankind most regard the newest song which the singer have thei will be afraid that he mai be prais not new song but a new kind of song and thi ought not to be prais or conceiv to be the mean of the poet for ani music innov is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibit so damon tell me and i can quit believ himh sai that when mode of music chang the fundament law of the state alwai chang with them ye said adeimantu and you mai add my suffrag to damon and your own then i said our guardian must lai the foundat of their fortress in music ye he said the lawless of which you speak too easili steal in ye i repli in the form of amus and at first sight it appear harmless why ye he said and there is no harm were it not that littl by littl thi spirit of licenc find a home impercept penetr into manner and custom whenc issu with greater forc it invad contract between man and man and from contract goe on to law and constitut in utter reckless end at last socrat by an overthrow of all right privat as well as public is that true i said that is my belief he repli then as i wa sai our youth should be train from the first in a stricter system for if amus becom lawless and the youth themselv becom lawless thei can never grow up into wellconduct and virtuou citizen veri true he said and when thei have made a good begin in plai and by the help of music have gain the habit of good order then thi habit of order in a manner how unlik the lawless plai of the other will accompani them in all their action and be a principl of growth to them and if there be ani fallen place in the state will rais them up again veri true he said thu educ thei will invent for themselv ani lesser rule which their predecessor have altogeth neglect what do you mean i mean such thing as thesewhen the young ar to be silent befor their elder how thei ar to show respect to them by stand and make them sit what honour is due to parent what garment or shoe ar to be worn the mode of dress the hair deport and manner in gener you would agre with me ye but there is i think small wisdom in legisl about such mattersi doubt if it is ever done nor ar ani precis written enact about them like to be last imposs it would seem adeimantu that the direct in which educ start a man will determin hi futur life doe not like alwai attract like to be sure until some on rare and grand result is reach which mai be good and mai be the revers of good that is not to be deni and for thi reason i said i shall not attempt to legisl further about them natur enough he repli well and about the busi of the agora and the ordinari deal between man and man or again about agreement with artisan about insult and injuri or the commenc of action and the appoint of juri what would you sai there mai also aris question about ani imposit and exact of market and harbour due which mai be requir and in gener about the regul of market polic harbour and the like but oh heaven shall we condescend to legisl on ani of these particular i think he said that there is no need to impos law about them on good men what regul ar necessari thei will find out soon enough for themselv ye i said my friend if god will onli preserv to them the law which we have given them and without divin help said adeimantu thei will go on for ever make and mend their law and their live in the hope of attain perfect you would compar them i said to those invalid who have no selfrestraint will not leav off their habit of intemper exactli ye i said and what a delight life thei lead thei ar alwai doctor and increas and complic their disord and alwai fanci that thei will be cure by ani nostrum which anybodi advis them to try such case ar veri common he said with invalid of thi sort ye i repli and the charm thing is that thei deem him their worst enemi who tell them the truth which is simpli that unless thei give up eat and drink and wench and idl neither drug nor cauteri nor spell nor amulet nor ani other remedi will avail charm he repli i see noth charm in go into a passion with a man who tell you what is right these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good grace assuredli not nor would you prais the behaviour of state which act like the men whom i wa just now describ for ar there not illord state in which the citizen ar forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitut and yet he who most sweetli court those who live under thi regim and indulg them and fawn upon them and is skil in anticip and gratifi their humour is held to be a great and good statesmando not these state resembl the person whom i wa describ ye he said the state ar as bad as the men and i am veri far from prais them but do you not admir i said the cool and dexter of these readi minist of polit corrupt ye he said i do but not of all of them for there ar some whom the applaus of the multitud ha delud into the belief that thei ar realli statesmen and these ar not much to be admir what do you mean i said you should have more feel for them when a man cannot measur and a great mani other who cannot measur declar that he is four cubit high can he help believ what thei sai nai he said certainli not in that case well then do not be angri with them for ar thei not as good as a plai try their hand at paltri reform such as i wa describ thei ar alwai fanci that by legisl thei will make an end of fraud in contract and the other rascal which i wa mention not know that thei ar in realiti cut off the head of a hydra ye he said that is just what thei ar do i conceiv i said that the true legisl will not troubl himself with thi class of enact whether concern law or the constitut either in an illord or in a wellord state for in the former thei ar quit useless and in the latter there will be no difficulti in devis them and mani of them will natur flow out of our previou regul what then he said is still remain to us of the work of legisl noth to us i repli but to apollo the god of delphi there remain the order of the greatest and noblest and chiefest thing of all which ar thei he said the institut of templ and sacrific and the entir servic of god demigod and hero also the order of the repositori of the dead and the rite which have to be observ by him who would propiti the inhabit of the world below these ar matter of which we ar ignor ourselv and as founder of a citi we should be unwis in trust them to ani interpret but our ancestr deiti he is the god who sit in the centr on the navel of the earth and he is the interpret of religion to all mankind you ar right and we will do as you propos but where amid all thi is justic son of ariston tell me where now that our citi ha been made habit light a candl and search and get your brother and polemarchu and the rest of our friend to help and let us see where in it we can discov justic and where injustic and in what thei differ from on anoth and which of them the man who would be happi should have for hi portion whether seen or unseen by god and men nonsens said glaucon did you not promis to search yourself sai that for you not to help justic in her need would be an impieti i do not deni that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join we will he repli well then i hope to make the discoveri in thi wai i mean to begin with the assumpt that our state if rightli order is perfect that is most certain and be perfect is therefor wise and valiant and temper and just that is likewis clear and whichev of these qualiti we find in the state the on which is not found will be the residu veri good if there were four thing and we were search for on of them wherev it might be the on sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further troubl or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearli be the on left veri true he said and is not a similar method to be pursu about the virtu which ar also four in number clearli first among the virtu found in the state wisdom come into view and in thi i detect a certain peculiar what is that the state which we have been describ is said to be wise as be good in counsel veri true and good counsel is clearli a kind of knowledg for not by ignor but by knowledg do men counsel well clearli and the kind of knowledg in a state ar mani and divers of cours there is the knowledg of the carpent but is that the sort of knowledg which give a citi the titl of wise and good in counsel certainli not that would onli give a citi the reput of skill in carpent then a citi is not to be call wise becaus possess a knowledg which counsel for the best about wooden implement certainli not nor by reason of a knowledg which advis about brazen pot i said nor as possess ani other similar knowledg not by reason of ani of them he said nor yet by reason of a knowledg which cultiv the earth that would give the citi the name of agricultur ye well i said and is there ani knowledg in our recentlyfound state among ani of the citizen which advis not about ani particular thing in the state but about the whole and consid how a state can best deal with itself and with other state there certainli is and what is thi knowledg and among whom is it found i ask it is the knowledg of the guardian he repli and is found among those whom we were just now describ as perfect guardian and what is the name which the citi deriv from the possess of thi sort of knowledg the name of good in counsel and truli wise and will there be in our citi more of these true guardian or more smith the smith he repli will be far more numer will not the guardian be the smallest of all the class who receiv a name from the profess of some kind of knowledg much the smallest and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledg which resid in thi presid and rule part of itself the whole state be thu constitut accord to natur will be wise and thi which ha the onli knowledg worthi to be call wisdom ha been ordain by natur to be of all class the least most true thu then i said the natur and place in the state of on of the four virtu ha somehow or other been discov and in my humbl opinion veri satisfactorili discov he repli again i said there is no difficulti in see the natur of courag and in what part that qualiti resid which give the name of courag to the state how do you mean why i said everi on who call ani state courag or cowardli will be think of the part which fight and goe out to war on the state behalf no on he repli would ever think of ani other the rest of the citizen mai be courag or mai be cowardli but their courag or cowardic will not as i conceiv have the effect of make the citi either the on or the other certainli not the citi will be courag in virtu of a portion of herself which preserv under all circumst that opinion about the natur of thing to be fear and not to be fear in which our legisl educ them and thi is what you term courag i should like to hear what you ar sai onc more for i do not think that i perfectli understand you i mean that courag is a kind of salvat salvat of what of the opinion respect thing to be fear what thei ar and of what natur which the law implant through educ and i mean by the word under all circumst to intim that in pleasur or in pain or under the influenc of desir or fear a man preserv and doe not lose thi opinion shall i give you an illustr if you pleas you know i said that dyer when thei want to dye wool for make the true seapurpl begin by select their white colour first thi thei prepar and dress with much care and pain in order that the white ground mai take the purpl hue in full perfect the dye then proce and whatev is dy in thi manner becom a fast colour and no wash either with lye or without them can take awai the bloom but when the ground ha not been duli prepar you will have notic how poor is the look either of purpl or of ani other colour ye he said i know that thei have a washedout and ridicul appear then now i said you will understand what our object wa in select our soldier and educ them in music and gymnast we were contriv influenc which would prepar them to take the dye of the law in perfect and the colour of their opinion about danger and of everi other opinion wa to be indel fix by their nurtur and train not to be wash awai by such potent lye as pleasuremighti agent far in wash the soul than ani soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desir the mightiest of all other solvent and thi sort of univers save power of true opinion in conform with law about real and fals danger i call and maintain to be courag unless you disagre but i agre he repli for i suppos that you mean to exclud mere uninstruct courag such as that of a wild beast or of a slavethi in your opinion is not the courag which the law ordain and ought to have anoth name most certainli then i mai infer courag to be such as you describ why ye said i you mai and if you add the word of a citizen you will not be far wronghereaft if you like we will carri the examin further but at present we ar seek not for courag but justic and for the purpos of our enquiri we have said enough you ar right he repli two virtu remain to be discov in the statefirst temper and then justic which is the end of our search veri true now can we find justic without troubl ourselv about temper i do not know how that can be accomplish he said nor do i desir that justic should be brought to light and temper lost sight of and therefor i wish that you would do me the favour of consid temper first certainli i repli i should not be justifi in refus your request then consid he said ye i repli i will and as far as i can at present see the virtu of temper ha more of the natur of harmoni and symphoni than the preced how so he ask temper i repli is the order or control of certain pleasur and desir thi is curious enough impli in the sai of a man be hi own master and other trace of the same notion mai be found in languag no doubt he said there is someth ridicul in the express master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these mode of speak the same person is denot certainli the mean is i believ that in the human soul there is a better and also a wors principl and when the better ha the wors under control then a man is said to be master of himself and thi is a term of prais but when ow to evil educ or associ the better principl which is also the smaller is overwhelm by the greater mass of the worsein thi case he is blame and is call the slave of self and unprincipl ye there is reason in that and now i said look at our newlycr state and there you will find on of these two condit realiz for the state as you will acknowledg mai be justli call master of itself if the word temper and selfmasteri truli express the rule of the better part over the wors ye he said i see that what you sai is true let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasur and desir and pain ar gener found in children and women and servant and in the freemen so call who ar of the lowest and more numer class certainli he said wherea the simpl and moder desir which follow reason and ar under the guidanc of mind and true opinion ar to be found onli in a few and those the best born and best educ veri true these two as you mai perceiv have a place in our state and the meaner desir of the mani ar held down by the virtuou desir and wisdom of the few that i perceiv he said then if there be ani citi which mai be describ as master of it own pleasur and desir and master of itself our mai claim such a design certainli he repli it mai also be call temper and for the same reason ye and if there be ani state in which ruler and subject will be agre as to the question who ar to rule that again will be our state undoubtedli and the citizen be thu agre among themselv in which class will temper be foundin the ruler or in the subject in both as i should imagin he repli do you observ that we were not far wrong in our guess that temper wa a sort of harmoni why so why becaus temper is unlik courag and wisdom each of which resid in a part onli the on make the state wise and the other valiant not so temper which extend to the whole and run through all the note of the scale and produc a harmoni of the weaker and the stronger and the middl class whether you suppos them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or number or wealth or anyth els most truli then mai we deem temper to be the agreement of the natur superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in state and individu i entir agre with you and so i said we mai consid three out of the four virtu to have been discov in our state the last of those qualiti which make a state virtuou must be justic if we onli knew what that wa the infer is obviou the time then ha arriv glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justic doe not steal awai and pass out of sight and escap us for beyond a doubt she is somewher in thi countri watch therefor and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follow who ha just ey enough to see what you show himthat is about as much as i am good for offer up a prayer with me and follow i will but you must show me the wai here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplex still we must push on let us push on here i saw someth halloo i said i begin to perceiv a track and i believ that the quarri will not escap good new he said truli i said we ar stupid fellow why so why my good sir at the begin of our enquiri ag ago there wa justic tumbl out at our feet and we never saw her noth could be more ridicul like peopl who go about look for what thei have in their handsthat wa the wai with usw look not at what we were seek but at what wa far off in the distanc and therefor i suppos we miss her what do you mean i mean to sai that in realiti for a long time past we have been talk of justic and have fail to recognis her i grow impati at the length of your exordium well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you rememb the origin principl which we were alwai lai down at the foundat of the state that on man should practis on thing onli the thing to which hi natur wa best adaptednow justic is thi principl or a part of it ye we often said that on man should do on thing onli further we affirm that justic wa do on own busi and not be a busybodi we said so again and again and mani other have said the same to us ye we said so then to do on own busi in a certain wai mai be assum to be justic can you tell me whenc i deriv thi infer i cannot but i should like to be told becaus i think that thi is the onli virtu which remain in the state when the other virtu of temper and courag and wisdom ar abstract and that thi is the ultim caus and condit of the exist of all of them and while remain in them is also their preserv and we were sai that if the three were discov by us justic would be the fourth or remain on that follow of necess if we ar ask to determin which of these four qualiti by it presenc contribut most to the excel of the state whether the agreement of ruler and subject or the preserv in the soldier of the opinion which the law ordain about the true natur of danger or wisdom and watch in the ruler or whether thi other which i am mention and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subjectth qualiti i mean of everi on do hi own work and not be a busybodi would claim the palmth question is not so easili answer certainli he repli there would be a difficulti in sai which then the power of each individu in the state to do hi own work appear to compet with the other polit virtu wisdom temper courag ye he said and the virtu which enter into thi competit is justic exactli let us look at the question from anoth point of view ar not the ruler in a state those to whom you would entrust the offic of determin suit at law certainli and ar suit decid on ani other ground but that a man mai neither take what is anoth nor be depriv of what is hi own ye that is their principl which is a just principl ye then on thi view also justic will be admit to be the have and do what is a man own and belong to him veri true think now and sai whether you agre with me or not suppos a carpent to be do the busi of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpent and suppos them to exchang their implement or their duti or the same person to be do the work of both or whatev be the chang do you think that ani great harm would result to the state not much but when the cobbler or ani other man whom natur design to be a trader have hi heart lift up by wealth or strength or the number of hi follow or ani like advantag attempt to forc hi wai into the class of warrior or a warrior into that of legisl and guardian for which he is unfit and either to take the implement or the duti of the other or when on man is trader legisl and warrior all in on then i think you will agre with me in sai that thi interchang and thi meddl of on with anoth is the ruin of the state most true see then i said that there ar three distinct class ani meddl of on with anoth or the chang of on into anoth is the greatest harm to the state and mai be most justli term evildo precis and the greatest degre of evildo to on own citi would be term by you injustic certainli thi then is injustic and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliari and the guardian each do their own busi that is justic and will make the citi just i agre with you we will not i said be overposit as yet but if on trial thi concept of justic be verifi in the individu as well as in the state there will be no longer ani room for doubt if it be not verifi we must have a fresh enquiri first let us complet the old investig which we began as you rememb under the impress that if we could previous examin justic on the larger scale there would be less difficulti in discern her in the individu that larger exampl appear to be the state and accordingli we construct as good a on as we could know well that in the good state justic would be found let the discoveri which we made be now appli to the individualif thei agre we shall be satisfi or if there be a differ in the individu we will come back to the state and have anoth trial of the theori the friction of the two when rub togeth mai possibl strike a light in which justic will shine forth and the vision which is then reveal we will fix in our soul that will be in regular cours let us do as you sai i proceed to ask when two thing a greater and less ar call by the same name ar thei like or unlik in so far as thei ar call the same like he repli the just man then if we regard the idea of justic onli will be like the just state he will and a state wa thought by us to be just when the three class in the state sever did their own busi and also thought to be temper and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affect and qualiti of these same class true he said and so of the individu we mai assum that he ha the same three principl in hi own soul which ar found in the state and he mai be rightli describ in the same term becaus he is affect in the same manner certainli he said onc more then o my friend we have alight upon an easi questionwheth the soul ha these three principl or not an easi question nai rather socrat the proverb hold that hard is the good veri true i said and i do not think that the method which we ar emploi is at all adequ to the accur solut of thi question the true method is anoth and a longer on still we mai arriv at a solut not below the level of the previou enquiri mai we not be satisfi with that he saidund the circumst i am quit content i too i repli shall be extrem well satisfi then faint not in pursu the specul he said must we not acknowledg i said that in each of us there ar the same principl and habit which there ar in the state and that from the individu thei pass into the statehow els can thei come there take the qualiti of passion or spiritit would be ridicul to imagin that thi qualiti when found in state is not deriv from the individu who ar suppos to possess it eg the thracian scythian and in gener the northern nation and the same mai be said of the love of knowledg which is the special characterist of our part of the world or of the love of monei which mai with equal truth be attribut to the phoenician and egyptian exactli so he said there is no difficulti in understand thi none whatev but the question is not quit so easi when we proce to ask whether these principl ar three or on whether that is to sai we learn with on part of our natur ar angri with anoth and with a third part desir the satisfact of our natur appetit or whether the whole soul come into plai in each sort of actionto determin that is the difficulti ye he said there li the difficulti then let us now try and determin whether thei ar the same or differ how can we he ask i repli as follow the same thing clearli cannot act or be act upon in the same part or in relat to the same thing at the same time in contrari wai and therefor whenev thi contradict occur in thing appar the same we know that thei ar realli not the same but differ good for exampl i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part imposs still i said let us have a more precis statement of term lest we should hereaft fall out by the wai imagin the case of a man who is stand and also move hi hand and hi head and suppos a person to sai that on and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same momentto such a mode of speech we should object and should rather sai that on part of him is in motion while anoth is at rest veri true and suppos the objector to refin still further and to draw the nice distinct that not onli part of top but whole top when thei spin round with their peg fix on the spot ar at rest and in motion at the same time and he mai sai the same of anyth which revolv in the same spot hi object would not be admit by us becaus in such case thing ar not at rest and in motion in the same part of themselv we should rather sai that thei have both an axi and a circumfer and that the axi stand still for there is no deviat from the perpendicular and that the circumfer goe round but if while revolv the axi inclin either to the right or left forward or backward then in no point of view can thei be at rest that is the correct mode of describ them he repli then none of these object will confus us or inclin us to believ that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relat to the same thing can act or be act upon in contrari wai certainli not accord to my wai of think yet i said that we mai not be compel to examin all such object and prove at length that thei ar untru let us assum their absurd and go forward on the understand that hereaft if thi assumpt turn out to be untru all the consequ which follow shall be withdrawn ye he said that will be the best wai well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desir and avers attract and repuls ar all of them opposit whether thei ar regard as activ or passiv for that make no differ in the fact of their opposit ye he said thei ar opposit well i said and hunger and thirst and the desir in gener and again will and wishingal these you would refer to the class alreadi mention you would saywould you notthat the soul of him who desir is seek after the object of hi desir or that he is draw to himself the thing which he wish to possess or again when a person want anyth to be given him hi mind long for the realiz of hi desir intim hi wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been ask a question veri true and what would you sai of unwilling and dislik and the absenc of desir should not these be refer to the opposit class of repuls and reject certainli admit thi to be true of desir gener let us suppos a particular class of desir and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as thei ar term which ar the most obviou of them let us take that class he said the object of on is food and of the other drink ye and here come the point is not thirst the desir which the soul ha of drink and of drink onli not of drink qualifi by anyth els for exampl warm or cold or much or littl or in a word drink of ani particular sort but if the thirst be accompani by heat then the desir is of cold drink or if accompani by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excess then the drink which is desir will be excess or if not great the quantiti of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simpl will desir drink pure and simpl which is the natur satisfact of thirst as food is of hunger ye he said the simpl desir is as you sai in everi case of the simpl object and the qualifi desir of the qualifi object but here a confus mai aris and i should wish to guard against an oppon start up and sai that no man desir drink onli but good drink or food onli but good food for good is the univers object of desir and thirst be a desir will necessarili be thirst after good drink and the same is true of everi other desir ye he repli the oppon might have someth to sai nevertheless i should still maintain that of rel some have a qualiti attach to either term of the relat other ar simpl and have their correl simpl i do not know what you mean well you know of cours that the greater is rel to the less certainli and the much greater to the much less ye and the sometim greater to the sometim less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be certainli he said and so of more and less and of other correl term such as the doubl and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of ani other relativesi not thi true of all of them ye and doe not the same principl hold in the scienc the object of scienc is knowledg assum that to be the true definit but the object of a particular scienc is a particular kind of knowledg i mean for exampl that the scienc of housebuild is a kind of knowledg which is defin and distinguish from other kind and is therefor term architectur certainli becaus it ha a particular qualiti which no other ha ye and it ha thi particular qualiti becaus it ha an object of a particular kind and thi is true of the other art and scienc ye now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my origin mean in what i said about rel my mean wa that if on term of a relat is taken alon the other is taken alon if on term is qualifi the other is also qualifi i do not mean to sai that rel mai not be dispar or that the scienc of health is healthi or of diseas necessarili diseas or that the scienc of good and evil ar therefor good and evil but onli that when the term scienc is no longer us absolut but ha a qualifi object which in thi case is the natur of health and diseas it becom defin and is henc call not mere scienc but the scienc of medicin i quit understand and i think as you do would you not sai that thirst is on of these essenti rel term have clearli a relat ye thirst is rel to drink and a certain kind of thirst is rel to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alon is neither of much nor littl nor of good nor bad nor of ani particular kind of drink but of drink onli certainli then the soul of the thirsti on in so far as he is thirsti desir onli drink for thi he yearn and tri to obtain it that is plain and if you suppos someth which pull a thirsti soul awai from drink that must be differ from the thirsti principl which draw him like a beast to drink for as we were sai the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrari wai about the same imposs no more than you can sai that the hand of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you sai is that on hand push and the other pull exactli so he repli and might a man be thirsti and yet unwil to drink ye he said it constantli happen and in such a case what is on to sai would you not sai that there wa someth in the soul bid a man to drink and someth els forbid him which is other and stronger than the principl which bid him i should sai so and the forbid principl is deriv from reason and that which bid and attract proce from passion and diseas clearli then we mai fairli assum that thei ar two and that thei differ from on anoth the on with which a man reason we mai call the ration principl of the soul the other with which he love and hunger and thirst and feel the flutter of ani other desir mai be term the irrat or appetit the alli of sundri pleasur and satisfact ye he said we mai fairli assum them to be differ then let us final determin that there ar two principl exist in the soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to on of the preced i should be inclin to sayakin to desir well i said there is a stori which i rememb to have heard and in which i put faith the stori is that leontiu the son of aglaion come up on dai from the piraeu under the north wall on the outsid observ some dead bodi ly on the ground at the place of execut he felt a desir to see them and also a dread and abhorr of them for a time he struggl and cover hi ey but at length the desir got the better of him and forc them open he ran up to the dead bodi sai look ye wretch take your fill of the fair sight i have heard the stori myself he said the moral of the tale is that anger at time goe to war with desir as though thei were two distinct thing ye that is the mean he said and ar there not mani other case in which we observ that when a man desir violent prevail over hi reason he revil himself and is angri at the violenc within him and that in thi struggl which is like the struggl of faction in a state hi spirit is on the side of hi reasonbut for the passion or spirit element to take part with the desir when reason decid that she should not be oppos is a sort of thing which i believ that you never observ occur in yourself nor as i should imagin in ani on els certainli not suppos that a man think he ha done a wrong to anoth the nobler he is the less abl is he to feel indign at ani suffer such as hunger or cold or ani other pain which the injur person mai inflict upon himthes he deem to be just and as i sai hi anger refus to be excit by them true he said but when he think that he is the suffer of the wrong then he boil and chafe and is on the side of what he believ to be justic and becaus he suffer hunger or cold or other pain he is onli the more determin to persever and conquer hi nobl spirit will not be quell until he either slai or is slain or until he hear the voic of the shepherd that is reason bid hi dog bark no more the illustr is perfect he repli and in our state as we were sai the auxiliari were to be dog and to hear the voic of the ruler who ar their shepherd i perceiv i said that you quit understand me there is howev a further point which i wish you to consid what point you rememb that passion or spirit appear at first sight to be a kind of desir but now we should sai quit the contrari for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrai on the side of the ration principl most assuredli but a further question aris is passion differ from reason also or onli a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principl in the soul there will onli be two the ration and the concupisc or rather as the state wa compos of three class trader auxiliari counsellor so mai there not be in the individu soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupt by bad educ is the natur auxiliari of reason ye he said there must be a third ye i repli if passion which ha alreadi been shown to be differ from desir turn out also to be differ from reason but that is easili provedw mai observ even in young children that thei ar full of spirit almost as soon as thei ar born wherea some of them never seem to attain to the us of reason and most of them late enough excel i said and you mai see passion equal in brute anim which is a further proof of the truth of what you ar sai and we mai onc more appeal to the word of homer which have been alreadi quot by us he smote hi breast and thu rebuk hi soul for in thi vers homer ha clearli suppos the power which reason about the better and wors to be differ from the unreason anger which is rebuk by it veri true he said and so after much toss we have reach land and ar fairli agre that the same principl which exist in the state exist also in the individu and that thei ar three in number exactli must we not then infer that the individu is wise in the same wai and in virtu of the same qualiti which make the state wise certainli also that the same qualiti which constitut courag in the state constitut courag in the individu and that both the state and the individu bear the same relat to all the other virtu assuredli and the individu will be acknowledg by us to be just in the same wai in which the state is just that follow of cours we cannot but rememb that the justic of the state consist in each of the three class do the work of it own class we ar not veri like to have forgotten he said we must recollect that the individu in whom the sever qualiti of hi natur do their own work will be just and will do hi own work ye he said we must rememb that too and ought not the ration principl which is wise and ha the care of the whole soul to rule and the passion or spirit principl to be the subject and alli certainli and as we were sai the unit influenc of music and gymnast will bring them into accord nerv and sustain the reason with nobl word and lesson and moder and sooth and civil the wild of passion by harmoni and rhythm quit true he said and these two thu nurtur and educ and have learn truli to know their own function will rule over the concupisc which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by natur most insati of gain over thi thei will keep guard lest wax great and strong with the ful of bodili pleasur as thei ar term the concupisc soul no longer confin to her own sphere should attempt to enslav and rule those who ar not her naturalborn subject and overturn the whole life of man veri true he said both togeth will thei not be the best defend of the whole soul and the whole bodi against attack from without the on counsel and the other fight under hi leader and courag execut hi command and counsel true and he is to be deem courag whose spirit retain in pleasur and in pain the command of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear right he repli and him we call wise who ha in him that littl part which rule and which proclaim these command that part too be suppos to have a knowledg of what is for the interest of each of the three part and of the whole assuredli and would you not sai that he is temper who ha these same element in friendli harmoni in whom the on rule principl of reason and the two subject on of spirit and desir ar equal agre that reason ought to rule and do not rebel certainli he said that is the true account of temper whether in the state or individu and sure i said we have explain again and again how and by virtu of what qualiti a man will be just that is veri certain and is justic dimmer in the individu and is her form differ or is she the same which we found her to be in the state there is no differ in my opinion he said becaus if ani doubt is still linger in our mind a few commonplac instanc will satisfi us of the truth of what i am sai what sort of instanc do you mean if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is train in the principl of such a state will be less like than the unjust to make awai with a deposit of gold or silver would ani on deni thi no on he repli will the just man or citizen ever be guilti of sacrileg or theft or treacheri either to hi friend or to hi countri never neither will he ever break faith where there have been oath or agreement imposs no on will be less like to commit adulteri or to dishonour hi father and mother or to fail in hi religi duti no on and the reason is that each part of him is do it own busi whether in rule or be rule exactli so ar you satisfi then that the qualiti which make such men and such state is justic or do you hope to discov some other not i inde then our dream ha been realiz and the suspicion which we entertain at the begin of our work of construct that some divin power must have conduct us to a primari form of justic ha now been verifi ye certainli and the divis of labour which requir the carpent and the shoemak and the rest of the citizen to be do each hi own busi and not anoth wa a shadow of justic and for that reason it wa of us clearli but in realiti justic wa such as we were describ be concern howev not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concern of man for the just man doe not permit the sever element within him to interfer with on anoth or ani of them to do the work of othersh set in order hi own inner life and is hi own master and hi own law and at peac with himself and when he ha bound togeth the three principl within him which mai be compar to the higher lower and middl note of the scale and the intermedi intervalswhen he ha bound all these togeth and is no longer mani but ha becom on entir temper and perfectli adjust natur then he proce to act if he ha to act whether in a matter of properti or in the treatment of the bodi or in some affair of polit or privat busi alwai think and call that which preserv and cooper with thi harmoni condit just and good action and the knowledg which presid over it wisdom and that which at ani time impair thi condit he will call unjust action and the opinion which presid over it ignor you have said the exact truth socrat veri good and if we were to affirm that we had discov the just man and the just state and the natur of justic in each of them we should not be tell a falsehood most certainli not mai we sai so then let us sai so and now i said injustic ha to be consid clearli must not injustic be a strife which aris among the three principlesa meddlesom and interfer and rise up of a part of the soul against the whole an assert of unlaw author which is made by a rebelli subject against a true princ of whom he is the natur vassalwhat is all thi confus and delus but injustic and intemper and cowardic and ignor and everi form of vice exactli so and if the natur of justic and injustic be known then the mean of act unjustli and be unjust or again of act justli will also be perfectli clear what do you mean he said why i said thei ar like diseas and health be in the soul just what diseas and health ar in the bodi how so he said why i said that which is healthi caus health and that which is unhealthi caus diseas ye and just action caus justic and unjust action caus injustic that is certain and the creation of health is the institut of a natur order and govern of on by anoth in the part of the bodi and the creation of diseas is the product of a state of thing at varianc with thi natur order true and is not the creation of justic the institut of a natur order and govern of on by anoth in the part of the soul and the creation of injustic the product of a state of thing at varianc with the natur order exactli so he said then virtu is the health and beauti and wellb of the soul and vice the diseas and weak and deform of the same true and do not good practic lead to virtu and evil practic to vice assuredli still our old question of the compar advantag of justic and injustic ha not been answer which is the more profit to be just and act justli and practis virtu whether seen or unseen of god and men or to be unjust and act unjustli if onli unpunish and unreform in my judgment socrat the question ha now becom ridicul we know that when the bodili constitut is gone life is no longer endur though pamper with all kind of meat and drink and have all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the veri essenc of the vital principl is undermin and corrupt life is still worth have to a man if onli he be allow to do whatev he like with the singl except that he is not to acquir justic and virtu or to escap from injustic and vice assum them both to be such as we have describ ye i said the question is as you sai ridicul still as we ar near the spot at which we mai see the truth in the clearest manner with our own ey let us not faint by the wai certainli not he repli come up hither i said and behold the variou form of vice those of them i mean which ar worth look at i am follow you he repli proce i said the argument seem to have reach a height from which as from some tower of specul a man mai look down and see that virtu is on but that the form of vice ar innumer there be four special on which ar deserv of note what do you mean he said i mean i repli that there appear to be as mani form of the soul as there ar distinct form of the state how mani there ar five of the state and five of the soul i said what ar thei the first i said is that which we have been describ and which mai be said to have two name monarchi and aristocraci accordingli as rule is exercis by on distinguish man or by mani true he repli but i regard the two name as describ on form onli for whether the govern is in the hand of on or mani if the governor have been train in the manner which we have suppos the fundament law of the state will be maintain that is true he repli book v such is the good and true citi or state and the good and true man is of the same pattern and if thi is right everi other is wrong and the evil is on which affect not onli the order of the state but also the regul of the individu soul and is exhibit in four form what ar thei he said i wa proceed to tell the order in which the four evil form appear to me to succe on anoth when polemarchu who wa sit a littl wai off just beyond adeimantu began to whisper to him stretch forth hi hand he took hold of the upper part of hi coat by the shoulder and drew him toward him lean forward himself so as to be quit close and sai someth in hi ear of which i onli caught the word shall we let him off or what shall we do certainli not said adeimantu rais hi voic who is it i said whom you ar refus to let off you he said i repeat why am i especi not to be let off why he said we think that you ar lazi and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a veri import part of the stori and you fanci that we shall not notic your airi wai of proceed as if it were selfevid to everybodi that in the matter of women and children friend have all thing in common and wa i not right adeimantu ye he said but what is right in thi particular case like everyth els requir to be explain for commun mai be of mani kind pleas therefor to sai what sort of commun you mean we have been long expect that you would tell us someth about the famili life of your citizenshow thei will bring children into the world and rear them when thei have arriv and in gener what is the natur of thi commun of women and childrenfor we ar of opinion that the right or wrong manag of such matter will have a great and paramount influenc on the state for good or for evil and now sinc the question is still undetermin and you ar take in hand anoth state we have resolv as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all thi to that resolut said glaucon you mai regard me as sai agre and without more ado said thrasymachu you mai consid us all to be equal agre i said you know not what you ar do in thu assail me what an argument ar you rais about the state just as i thought that i had finish and wa onli too glad that i had laid thi question to sleep and wa reflect how fortun i wa in your accept of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the veri foundat ignor of what a hornet nest of word you ar stir now i foresaw thi gather troubl and avoid it for what purpos do you conceiv that we have come here said thrasymachusto look for gold or to hear discours ye but discours should have a limit ye socrat said glaucon and the whole of life is the onli limit which wise men assign to the hear of such discours but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own wai what sort of commun of women and children is thi which is to prevail among our guardian and how shall we manag the period between birth and educ which seem to requir the greatest care tell us how these thing will be ye my simpl friend but the answer is the revers of easi mani more doubt aris about thi than about our previou conclus for the practic of what is said mai be doubt and look at in anoth point of view whether the scheme if ever so practic would be for the best is also doubt henc i feel a reluct to approach the subject lest our aspir my dear friend should turn out to be a dream onli fear not he repli for your audienc will not be hard upon you thei ar not sceptic or hostil i said my good friend i suppos that you mean to encourag me by these word ye he said then let me tell you that you ar do just the revers the encourag which you offer would have been all veri well had i myself believ that i knew what i wa talk about to declar the truth about matter of high interest which a man honour and love among wise men who love him need occas no fear or falter in hi mind but to carri on an argument when you ar yourself onli a hesit enquir which is my condit is a danger and slipperi thing and the danger is not that i shall be laugh at of which the fear would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my foot and drag my friend after me in my fall and i prai nemesi not to visit upon me the word which i am go to utter for i do inde believ that to be an involuntari homicid is a less crime than to be a deceiv about beauti or good or justic in the matter of law and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemi than among friend and therefor you do well to encourag me glaucon laugh and said well then socrat in case you and your argument do us ani seriou injuri you shall be acquit beforehand of the homicid and shall not be held to be a deceiv take courag then and speak well i said the law sai that when a man is acquit he is free from guilt and what hold at law mai hold in argument then why should you mind well i repli i suppos that i must retrac my step and sai what i perhap ought to have said befor in the proper place the part of the men ha been plai out and now properli enough come the turn of the women of them i will proce to speak and the more readili sinc i am invit by you for men born and educ like our citizen the onli wai in my opinion of arriv at a right conclus about the possess and us of women and children is to follow the path on which we origin start when we said that the men were to be the guardian and watchdog of the herd true let us further suppos the birth and educ of our women to be subject to similar or nearli similar regul then we shall see whether the result accord with our design what do you mean what i mean mai be put into the form of a question i said ar dog divid into he and she or do thei both share equal in hunt and in keep watch and in the other duti of dog or do we entrust to the male the entir and exclus care of the flock while we leav the femal at home under the idea that the bear and suckl their puppi is labour enough for them no he said thei share alik the onli differ between them is that the male ar stronger and the femal weaker but can you us differ anim for the same purpos unless thei ar bred and fed in the same wai you cannot then if women ar to have the same duti as men thei must have the same nurtur and educ ye the educ which wa assign to the men wa music and gymnast ye then women must be taught music and gymnast and also the art of war which thei must practis like the men that is the infer i suppos i should rather expect i said that sever of our propos if thei ar carri out be unusu mai appear ridicul no doubt of it ye and the most ridicul thing of all will be the sight of women nake in the palaestra exercis with the men especi when thei ar no longer young thei certainli will not be a vision of beauti ani more than the enthusiast old men who in spite of wrinkl and ugli continu to frequent the gymnasia ye inde he said accord to present notion the propos would be thought ridicul but then i said as we have determin to speak our mind we must not fear the jest of the wit which will be direct against thi sort of innov how thei will talk of women attain both in music and gymnast and abov all about their wear armour and ride upon horseback veri true he repli yet have begun we must go forward to the rough place of the law at the same time beg of these gentlemen for onc in their life to be seriou not long ago as we shall remind them the hellen were of the opinion which is still gener receiv among the barbarian that the sight of a nake man wa ridicul and improp and when first the cretan and then the lacedaemonian introduc the custom the wit of that dai might equal have ridicul the innov no doubt but when experi show that to let all thing be uncov wa far better than to cover them up and the ludicr effect to the outward ey vanish befor the better principl which reason assert then the man wa perceiv to be a fool who direct the shaft of hi ridicul at ani other sight but that of folli and vice or serious inclin to weigh the beauti by ani other standard but that of the good veri true he repli first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understand about the natur of woman is she capabl of share either wholli or partial in the action of men or not at all and is the art of war on of those art in which she can or can not share that will be the best wai of commenc the enquiri and will probabl lead to the fairest conclus that will be much the best wai shall we take the other side first and begin by argu against ourselv in thi manner the adversari posit will not be undefend why not he said then let us put a speech into the mouth of our oppon thei will sai socrat and glaucon no adversari need convict you for you yourselv at the first foundat of the state admit the principl that everybodi wa to do the on work suit to hi own natur and certainli if i am not mistaken such an admiss wa made by us and do not the natur of men and women differ veri much inde and we shall repli of cours thei do then we shall be ask whether the task assign to men and to women should not be differ and such as ar agreeabl to their differ natur certainli thei should but if so have you not fallen into a seriou inconsist in sai that men and women whose natur ar so entir differ ought to perform the same actionswhat defenc will you make for us my good sir against ani on who offer these object that is not an easi question to answer when ask suddenli and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side these ar the object glaucon and there ar mani other of a like kind which i foresaw long ago thei made me afraid and reluct to take in hand ani law about the possess and nurtur of women and children by zeu he said the problem to be solv is anyth but easi why ye i said but the fact is that when a man is out of hi depth whether he ha fallen into a littl swim bath or into mid ocean he ha to swim all the same veri true and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that arion dolphin or some other miracul help mai save us i suppos so he said well then let us see if ani wai of escap can be found we acknowledgeddid we not that differ natur ought to have differ pursuit and that men and women natur ar differ and now what ar we sayingthat differ natur ought to have the same pursuitsthi is the inconsist which is charg upon us precis verili glaucon i said gloriou is the power of the art of contradict why do you sai so becaus i think that mani a man fall into the practic against hi will when he think that he is reason he is realli disput just becaus he cannot defin and divid and so know that of which he is speak and he will pursu a mere verbal opposit in the spirit of content and not of fair discuss ye he repli such is veri often the case but what ha that to do with us and our argument a great deal for there is certainli a danger of our get unintention into a verbal opposit in what wai why we valiantli and pugnaci insist upon the verbal truth that differ natur ought to have differ pursuit but we never consid at all what wa the mean of same or differ of natur or why we distinguish them when we assign differ pursuit to differ natur and the same to the same natur why no he said that wa never consid by us i said suppos that by wai of illustr we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposit in natur between bald men and hairi men and if thi is admit by us then if bald men ar cobbler we should forbid the hairi men to be cobbler and convers that would be a jest he said ye i said a jest and why becaus we never meant when we construct the state that the opposit of natur should extend to everi differ but onli to those differ which affect the pursuit in which the individu is engag we should have argu for exampl that a physician and on who is in mind a physician mai be said to have the same natur true wherea the physician and the carpent have differ natur certainli and if i said the male and femal sex appear to differ in their fit for ani art or pursuit we should sai that such pursuit or art ought to be assign to on or the other of them but if the differ consist onli in women bear and men beget children thi doe not amount to a proof that a woman differ from a man in respect of the sort of educ she should receiv and we shall therefor continu to maintain that our guardian and their wive ought to have the same pursuit veri true he said next we shall ask our oppon how in refer to ani of the pursuit or art of civic life the natur of a woman differ from that of a man that will be quit fair and perhap he like yourself will repli that to give a suffici answer on the instant is not easi but after a littl reflect there is no difficulti ye perhap suppos then that we invit him to accompani us in the argument and then we mai hope to show him that there is noth peculiar in the constitut of women which would affect them in the administr of the state by all mean let us sai to him come now and we will ask you a questionwhen you spoke of a natur gift or not gift in ani respect did you mean to sai that on man will acquir a thing easili anoth with difficulti a littl learn will lead the on to discov a great deal wherea the other after much studi and applic no sooner learn than he forget or again did you mean that the on ha a bodi which is a good servant to hi mind while the bodi of the other is a hindranc to himwould not these be the sort of differ which distinguish the man gift by natur from the on who is ungift no on will deni that and can you mention ani pursuit of mankind in which the male sex ha not all these gift and qualiti in a higher degre than the femal need i wast time in speak of the art of weav and the manag of pancak and preserv in which womankind doe realli appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all thing the most absurd you ar quit right he repli in maintain the gener inferior of the femal sex although mani women ar in mani thing superior to mani men yet on the whole what you sai is true and if so my friend i said there is no special faculti of administr in a state which a woman ha becaus she is a woman or which a man ha by virtu of hi sex but the gift of natur ar alik diffus in both all the pursuit of men ar the pursuit of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man veri true then ar we to impos all our enact on men and none of them on women that will never do on woman ha a gift of heal anoth not on is a musician and anoth ha no music in her natur veri true and on woman ha a turn for gymnast and militari exercis and anoth is unwarlik and hate gymnast certainli and on woman is a philosoph and anoth is an enemi of philosophi on ha spirit and anoth is without spirit that is also true then on woman will have the temper of a guardian and anoth not wa not the select of the male guardian determin by differ of thi sort ye men and women alik possess the qualiti which make a guardian thei differ onli in their compar strength or weak obvious and those women who have such qualiti ar to be select as the companion and colleagu of men who have similar qualiti and whom thei resembl in capac and in charact veri true and ought not the same natur to have the same pursuit thei ought then as we were sai befor there is noth unnatur in assign music and gymnast to the wive of the guardiansto that point we come round again certainli not the law which we then enact wa agreeabl to natur and therefor not an imposs or mere aspir and the contrari practic which prevail at present is in realiti a violat of natur that appear to be true we had to consid first whether our propos were possibl and secondli whether thei were the most benefici ye and the possibl ha been acknowledg ye the veri great benefit ha next to be establish quit so you will admit that the same educ which make a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their origin natur is the same ye i should like to ask you a question what is it would you sai that all men ar equal in excel or is on man better than anoth the latter and in the commonwealth which we were found do you conceiv the guardian who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobbler whose educ ha been cobbl what a ridicul question you have answer me i repli well and mai we not further sai that our guardian ar the best of our citizen by far the best and will not their wive be the best women ye by far the best and can there be anyth better for the interest of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possibl there can be noth better and thi is what the art of music and gymnast when present in such manner as we have describ will accomplish certainli then we have made an enact not onli possibl but in the highest degre benefici to the state true then let the wive of our guardian strip for their virtu will be their robe and let them share in the toil of war and the defenc of their countri onli in the distribut of labour the lighter ar to be assign to the women who ar the weaker natur but in other respect their duti ar to be the same and as for the man who laugh at nake women exercis their bodi from the best of motiv in hi laughter he is pluck a fruit of unrip wisdom and he himself is ignor of what he is laugh at or what he is aboutfor that is and ever will be the best of sai that the us is the nobl and the hurt is the base veri true here then is on difficulti in our law about women which we mai sai that we have now escap the wave ha not swallow us up aliv for enact that the guardian of either sex should have all their pursuit in common to the util and also to the possibl of thi arrang the consist of the argument with itself bear wit ye that wa a mighti wave which you have escap ye i said but a greater is come you will not think much of thi when you see the next go on let me see the law i said which is the sequel of thi and of all that ha preced is to the follow effectthat the wive of our guardian ar to be common and their children ar to be common and no parent is to know hi own child nor ani child hi parent ye he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibl as well as the util of such a law ar far more question i do not think i said that there can be ani disput about the veri great util of have wive and children in common the possibl is quit anoth matter and will be veri much disput i think that a good mani doubt mai be rais about both you impli that the two question must be combin i repli now i meant that you should admit the util and in thi wai as i thought i should escap from on of them and then there would remain onli the possibl but that littl attempt is detect and therefor you will pleas to give a defenc of both well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a littl favour let me feast my mind with the dream as dai dreamer ar in the habit of feast themselv when thei ar walk alon for befor thei have discov ani mean of effect their wishesthat is a matter which never troubl themthei would rather not tire themselv by think about possibl but assum that what thei desir is alreadi grant to them thei proce with their plan and delight in detail what thei mean to do when their wish ha come truethat is a wai which thei have of not do much good to a capac which wa never good for much now i myself am begin to lose heart and i should like with your permiss to pass over the question of possibl at present assum therefor the possibl of the propos i shall now proce to enquir how the ruler will carri out these arrang and i shall demonstr that our plan if execut will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardian first of all then if you have no object i will endeavour with your help to consid the advantag of the measur and hereaft the question of possibl i have no object proce first i think that if our ruler and their auxiliari ar to be worthi of the name which thei bear there must be willing to obei in the on and the power of command in the other the guardian must themselv obei the law and thei must also imit the spirit of them in ani detail which ar entrust to their care that is right he said you i said who ar their legisl have select the men will now select the women and give them to themthei must be as far as possibl of like natur with them and thei must live in common hous and meet at common meal none of them will have anyth special hi or her own thei will be togeth and will be brought up togeth and will associ at gymnast exercis and so thei will be drawn by a necess of their natur to have intercours with each othernecess is not too strong a word i think ye he saidnecess not geometr but anoth sort of necess which lover know and which is far more convinc and constrain to the mass of mankind true i said and thi glaucon like all the rest must proce after an orderli fashion in a citi of the bless licenti is an unholi thing which the ruler will forbid ye he said and it ought not to be permit then clearli the next thing will be to make matrimoni sacr in the highest degre and what is most benefici will be deem sacr exactli and how can marriag be made most beneficialthat is a question which i put to you becaus i see in your hous dog for hunt and of the nobler sort of bird not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attend to their pair and breed in what particular why in the first place although thei ar all of a good sort ar not some better than other true and do you breed from them all indiffer or do you take care to breed from the best onli from the best and do you take the oldest or the youngest or onli those of ripe ag i choos onli those of ripe ag and if care wa not taken in the breed your dog and bird would greatli deterior certainli and the same of hors and anim in gener undoubtedli good heaven my dear friend i said what consumm skill will our ruler need if the same principl hold of the human speci certainli the same principl hold but why doe thi involv ani particular skill becaus i said our ruler will often have to practis upon the bodi corpor with medicin now you know that when patient do not requir medicin but have onli to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practition is deem to be good enough but when medicin ha to be given then the doctor should be more of a man that is quit true he said but to what ar you allud i mean i repli that our ruler will find a consider dose of falsehood and deceit necessari for the good of their subject we were sai that the us of all these thing regard as medicin might be of advantag and we were veri right and thi law us of them seem like to be often need in the regul of marriag and birth how so why i said the principl ha been alreadi laid down that the best of either sex should be unit with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possibl and that thei should rear the offspr of the on sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintain in firstrat condit now these go on must be a secret which the ruler onli know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardian mai be term break out into rebellion veri true had we not better appoint certain festiv at which we will bring togeth the bride and bridegroom and sacrific will be offer and suitabl hymen song compos by our poet the number of wed is a matter which must be left to the discret of the ruler whose aim will be to preserv the averag of popul there ar mani other thing which thei will have to consid such as the effect of war and diseas and ani similar agenc in order as far as thi is possibl to prevent the state from becom either too larg or too small certainli he repli we shall have to invent some ingeni kind of lot which the less worthi mai draw on each occas of our bring them togeth and then thei will accus their own illluck and not the ruler to be sure he said and i think that our braver and better youth besid their other honour and reward might have greater facil of intercours with women given them their braveri will be a reason and such father ought to have as mani son as possibl true and the proper offic whether male or femal or both for offic ar to be held by women as well as by men ye the proper offic will take the offspr of the good parent to the pen or fold and there thei will deposit them with certain nurs who dwell in a separ quarter but the offspr of the inferior or of the better when thei chanc to be deform will be put awai in some mysteri unknown place as thei should be ye he said that must be done if the breed of the guardian is to be kept pure thei will provid for their nurtur and will bring the mother to the fold when thei ar full of milk take the greatest possibl care that no mother recognis her own child and other wetnurs mai be engag if more ar requir care will also be taken that the process of suckl shall not be protract too long and the mother will have no get up at night or other troubl but will hand over all thi sort of thing to the nurs and attend you suppos the wive of our guardian to have a fine easi time of it when thei ar have children why said i and so thei ought let us howev proce with our scheme we were sai that the parent should be in the prime of life veri true and what is the prime of life mai it not be defin as a period of about twenti year in a woman life and thirti in a man which year do you mean to includ a woman i said at twenti year of ag mai begin to bear children to the state and continu to bear them until forti a man mai begin at fiveandtwenti when he ha pass the point at which the puls of life beat quickest and continu to beget children until he be fiftyf certainli he said both in men and women those year ar the prime of physic as well as of intellectu vigour ani on abov or below the prescrib ag who take part in the public hymen shall be said to have done an unholi and unright thing the child of which he is the father if it steal into life will have been conceiv under auspic veri unlik the sacrific and prayer which at each hymen priestess and priest and the whole citi will offer that the new gener mai be better and more us than their good and us parent wherea hi child will be the offspr of dark and strang lust veri true he repli and the same law will appli to ani on of those within the prescrib ag who form a connect with ani woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the ruler for we shall sai that he is rais up a bastard to the state uncertifi and unconsecr veri true he repli thi appli howev onli to those who ar within the specifi ag after that we allow them to rang at will except that a man mai not marri hi daughter or hi daughter daughter or hi mother or hi mother mother and women on the other hand ar prohibit from marri their son or father or son son or father father and so on in either direct and we grant all thi accompani the permiss with strict order to prevent ani embryo which mai come into be from see the light and if ani forc a wai to the birth the parent must understand that the offspr of such an union cannot be maintain and arrang accordingli that also he said is a reason proposit but how will thei know who ar father and daughter and so on thei will never know the wai will be thisdat from the dai of the hymen the bridegroom who wa then marri will call all the male children who ar born in the seventh and tenth month afterward hi son and the femal children hi daughter and thei will call him father and he will call their children hi grandchildren and thei will call the elder gener grandfath and grandmoth all who were begotten at the time when their father and mother came togeth will be call their brother and sister and these as i wa sai will be forbidden to intermarri thi howev is not to be understood as an absolut prohibit of the marriag of brother and sister if the lot favour them and thei receiv the sanction of the pythian oracl the law will allow them quit right he repli such is the scheme glaucon accord to which the guardian of our state ar to have their wive and famili in common and now you would have the argument show that thi commun is consist with the rest of our politi and also that noth can be betterwould you not ye certainli shall we try to find a common basi by ask of ourselv what ought to be the chief aim of the legisl in make law and in the organ of a statewhat is the greatest good and what is the greatest evil and then consid whether our previou descript ha the stamp of the good or of the evil by all mean can there be ani greater evil than discord and distract and plural where uniti ought to reign or ani greater good than the bond of uniti there cannot and there is uniti where there is commun of pleasur and painswher all the citizen ar glad or griev on the same occas of joi and sorrow no doubt ye and where there is no common but onli privat feel a state is disorganizedwhen you have on half of the world triumph and the other plung in grief at the same event happen to the citi or the citizen certainli such differ commonli origin in a disagr about the us of the term mine and not mine hi and not hi exactli so and is not that the bestord state in which the greatest number of person appli the term mine and not mine in the same wai to the same thing quit true or that again which most nearli approach to the condit of the individuala in the bodi when but a finger of on of us is hurt the whole frame drawn toward the soul as a centr and form on kingdom under the rule power therein feel the hurt and sympath all togeth with the part affect and we sai that the man ha a pain in hi finger and the same express is us about ani other part of the bodi which ha a sensat of pain at suffer or of pleasur at the allevi of suffer veri true he repli and i agre with you that in the bestord state there is the nearest approach to thi common feel which you describ then when ani on of the citizen experi ani good or evil the whole state will make hi case their own and will either rejoic or sorrow with him ye he said that is what will happen in a wellord state it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether thi or some other form is most in accord with these fundament principl veri good our state like everi other ha ruler and subject true all of whom will call on anoth citizen of cours but is there not anoth name which peopl give to their ruler in other state gener thei call them master but in democrat state thei simpli call them ruler and in our state what other name besid that of citizen do the peopl give the ruler thei ar call saviour and helper he repli and what do the ruler call the peopl their maintain and fosterfath and what do thei call them in other state slave and what do the ruler call on anoth in other state fellowrul and what in our fellowguardian did you ever know an exampl in ani other state of a ruler who would speak of on of hi colleagu as hi friend and of anoth as not be hi friend ye veri often and the friend he regard and describ as on in whom he ha an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he ha no interest exactli but would ani of your guardian think or speak of ani other guardian as a stranger certainli he would not for everi on whom thei meet will be regard by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who ar thu connect with him capit i said but let me ask you onc more shall thei be a famili in name onli or shall thei in all their action be true to the name for exampl in the us of the word father would the care of a father be impli and the filial rever and duti and obedi to him which the law command and is the violat of these duti to be regard as an impiou and unright person who is not like to receiv much good either at the hand of god or of man ar these to be or not to be the strain which the children will hear repeat in their ear by all the citizen about those who ar intim to them to be their parent and the rest of their kinsfolk these he said and none other for what can be more ridicul than for them to utter the name of famili ti with the lip onli and not to act in the spirit of them then in our citi the languag of harmoni and concord will be more often heard than in ani other as i wa describ befor when ani on is well or ill the univers word will be with me it is well or it is ill most true and agreeabl to thi mode of think and speak were we not sai that thei will have their pleasur and pain in common ye and so thei will and thei will have a common interest in the same thing which thei will alik call my own and have thi common interest thei will have a common feel of pleasur and pain ye far more so than in other state and the reason of thi over and abov the gener constitut of the state will be that the guardian will have a commun of women and children that will be the chief reason and thi uniti of feel we admit to be the greatest good as wa impli in our own comparison of a wellord state to the relat of the bodi and the member when affect by pleasur or pain that we acknowledg and veri rightli then the commun of wive and children among our citizen is clearli the sourc of the greatest good to the state certainli and thi agre with the other principl which we were affirmingthat the guardian were not to have hous or land or ani other properti their pai wa to be their food which thei were to receiv from the other citizen and thei were to have no privat expens for we intend them to preserv their true charact of guardian right he repli both the commun of properti and the commun of famili as i am sai tend to make them more truli guardian thei will not tear the citi in piec by differ about mine and not mine each man drag ani acquisit which he ha made into a separ hous of hi own where he ha a separ wife and children and privat pleasur and pain but all will be affect as far as mai be by the same pleasur and pain becaus thei ar all of on opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefor thei all tend toward a common end certainli he repli and as thei have noth but their person which thei can call their own suit and complaint will have no exist among them thei will be deliv from all those quarrel of which monei or children or relat ar the occas of cours thei will neither will trial for assault or insult ever be like to occur among them for that equal should defend themselv against equal we shall maintain to be honour and right we shall make the protect of the person a matter of necess that is good he said ye and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man ha a quarrel with anoth he will satisfi hi resent then and there and not proce to more danger length certainli to the elder shall be assign the duti of rule and chastis the younger clearli nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do ani other violenc to an elder unless the magistr command him nor will he slight him in ani wai for there ar two guardian shame and fear mighti to prevent him shame which make men refrain from lai hand on those who ar to them in the relat of parent fear that the injur on will be succour by the other who ar hi brother son father that is true he repli then in everi wai the law will help the citizen to keep the peac with on anoth ye there will be no want of peac and as the guardian will never quarrel among themselv there will be no danger of the rest of the citi be divid either against them or against on anoth none whatev i hardli like even to mention the littl mean of which thei will be rid for thei ar beneath notic such for exampl as the flatteri of the rich by the poor and all the pain and pang which men experi in bring up a famili and in find monei to bui necessari for their household borrow and then repudi get how thei can and give the monei into the hand of women and slave to keepth mani evil of so mani kind which peopl suffer in thi wai ar mean enough and obviou enough and not worth speak of ye he said a man ha no need of ey in order to perceiv that and from all these evil thei will be deliv and their life will be bless as the life of olymp victor and yet more bless how so the olymp victor i said is deem happi in receiv a part onli of the blessed which is secur to our citizen who have won a more gloriou victori and have a more complet mainten at the public cost for the victori which thei have won is the salvat of the whole state and the crown with which thei and their children ar crown is the ful of all that life need thei receiv reward from the hand of their countri while live and after death have an honour burial ye he said and gloriou reward thei ar do you rememb i said how in the cours of the previou discuss some on who shall be nameless accus us of make our guardian unhappythei had noth and might have possess all thingsto whom we repli that if an occas offer we might perhap hereaft consid thi question but that as at present advis we would make our guardian truli guardian and that we were fashion the state with a view to the greatest happi not of ani particular class but of the whole ye i rememb and what do you sai now that the life of our protector is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olymp victorsi the life of shoemak or ani other artisan or of husbandmen to be compar with it certainli not at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewher that if ani of our guardian shall try to be happi in such a manner that he will ceas to be a guardian and is not content with thi safe and harmoni life which in our judgment is of all live the best but infatu by some youth conceit of happi which get up into hi head shall seek to appropri the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wise hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole if he were to consult me i should sai to him stai where you ar when you have the offer of such a life you agre then i said that men and women ar to have a common wai of life such as we have describedcommon educ common children and thei ar to watch over the citizen in common whether abid in the citi or go out to war thei ar to keep watch togeth and to hunt togeth like dog and alwai and in all thing as far as thei ar abl women ar to share with the men and in so do thei will do what is best and will not violat but preserv the natur relat of the sex i agre with you he repli the enquiri i said ha yet to be made whether such a commun be found possiblea among other anim so also among menand if possibl in what wai possibl you have anticip the question which i wa about to suggest there is no difficulti i said in see how war will be carri on by them how why of cours thei will go on expedit togeth and will take with them ani of their children who ar strong enough that after the manner of the artisan child thei mai look on at the work which thei will have to do when thei ar grown up and besid look on thei will have to help and be of us in war and to wait upon their father and mother did you never observ in the art how the potter boi look on and help long befor thei touch the wheel ye i have and shall potter be more care in educ their children and in give them the opportun of see and practis their duti than our guardian will be the idea is ridicul he said there is also the effect on the parent with whom as with other anim the presenc of their young on will be the greatest incent to valour that is quit true socrat and yet if thei ar defeat which mai often happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as their parent and the state will never recov true i said but would you never allow them to run ani risk i am far from sai that well but if thei ar ever to run a risk should thei not do so on some occas when if thei escap disast thei will be the better for it clearli whether the futur soldier do or do not see war in the dai of their youth is a veri import matter for the sake of which some risk mai fairli be incur ye veri import thi then must be our first stepto make our children spectat of war but we must also contriv that thei shall be secur against danger then all will be well true their parent mai be suppos not to be blind to the risk of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expedit ar safe and what danger that mai be assum and thei will take them on the safe expedit and be cautiou about the danger on true and thei will place them under the command of experienc veteran who will be their leader and teacher veri properli still the danger of war cannot be alwai foreseen there is a good deal of chanc about them true then against such chanc the children must be at onc furnish with wing in order that in the hour of need thei mai fly awai and escap what do you mean he said i mean that we must mount them on hors in their earliest youth and when thei have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the hors must not be spirit and warlik but the most tractabl and yet the swiftest that can be had in thi wai thei will get an excel view of what is hereaft to be their own busi and if there is danger thei have onli to follow their elder leader and escap i believ that you ar right he said next as to war what ar to be the relat of your soldier to on anoth and to their enemi i should be inclin to propos that the soldier who leav hi rank or throw awai hi arm or is guilti of ani other act of cowardic should be degrad into the rank of a husbandman or artisan what do you think by all mean i should sai and he who allow himself to be taken prison mai as well be made a present of to hi enemi he is their law prei and let them do what thei like with him certainli but the hero who ha distinguish himself what shall be done to him in the first place he shall receiv honour in the armi from hi youth comrad everi on of them in success shall crown him what do you sai i approv and what do you sai to hi receiv the right hand of fellowship to that too i agre but you will hardli agre to my next propos what is your propos that he should kiss and be kiss by them most certainli and i should be dispos to go further and sai let no on whom he ha a mind to kiss refus to be kiss by him while the expedit last so that if there be a lover in the armi whether hi love be youth or maiden he mai be more eager to win the prize of valour capit i said that the brave man is to have more wive than other ha been alreadi determin and he is to have first choic in such matter more than other in order that he mai have as mani children as possibl agre again there is anoth manner in which accord to homer brave youth should be honour for he tell how ajax after he had distinguish himself in battl wa reward with long chine which seem to be a compliment appropri to a hero in the flower of hi ag be not onli a tribut of honour but also a veri strengthen thing most true he said then in thi i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrific and on the like occas will honour the brave accord to the measur of their valour whether men or women with hymn and those other distinct which we were mention also with seat of preced and meat and full cup and in honour them we shall be at the same time train them that he repli is excel ye i said and when a man di glorious in war shall we not sai in the first place that he is of the golden race to be sure nai have we not the author of hesiod for affirm that when thei ar dead thei ar holi angel upon the earth author of good avert of evil the guardian of speechgift men ye and we accept hi author we must learn of the god how we ar to order the sepultur of divin and heroic personag and what is to be their special distinct and we must do as he bid by all mean and in ag to come we will rever them and kneel befor their sepulchr as at the grave of hero and not onli thei but ani who ar deem preemin good whether thei die from ag or in ani other wai shall be admit to the same honour that is veri right he said next how shall our soldier treat their enemi what about thi in what respect do you mean first of all in regard to slaveri do you think it right that hellen should enslav hellen state or allow other to enslav them if thei can help should not their custom be to spare them consid the danger which there is that the whole race mai on dai fall under the yoke of the barbarian to spare them is infinit better then no hellen should be own by them as a slave that is a rule which thei will observ and advis the other hellen to observ certainli he said thei will in thi wai be unit against the barbarian and will keep their hand off on anoth next as to the slain ought the conqueror i said to take anyth but their armour doe not the practic of despoil an enemi afford an excus for not face the battl coward skulk about the dead pretend that thei ar fulfil a duti and mani an armi befor now ha been lost from thi love of plunder veri true and is there not illiber and avaric in rob a corps and also a degre of mean and womanish in make an enemi of the dead bodi when the real enemi ha flown awai and left onli hi fight gear behind himi not thi rather like a dog who cannot get at hi assail quarrel with the stone which strike him instead veri like a dog he said then we must abstain from spoil the dead or hinder their burial ye he repli we most certainli must neither shall we offer up arm at the templ of the god least of all the arm of hellen if we care to maintain good feel with other hellen and inde we have reason to fear that the offer of spoil taken from kinsmen mai be a pollut unless command by the god himself veri true again as to the devast of hellen territori or the burn of hous what is to be the practic mai i have the pleasur he said of hear your opinion both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produc and no more shall i tell you why prai do why you see there is a differ in the name discord and war and i imagin that there is also a differ in their natur the on is express of what is intern and domest the other of what is extern and foreign and the first of the two is term discord and onli the second war that is a veri proper distinct he repli and mai i not observ with equal proprieti that the hellen race is all unit togeth by ti of blood and friendship and alien and strang to the barbarian veri good he said and therefor when hellen fight with barbarian and barbarian with hellen thei will be describ by us as be at war when thei fight and by natur enemi and thi kind of antagon should be call war but when hellen fight with on anoth we shall sai that hella is then in a state of disord and discord thei be by natur friend and such enmiti is to be call discord i agre consid then i said when that which we have acknowledg to be discord occur and a citi is divid if both parti destroi the land and burn the hous of on anoth how wick doe the strife appear no true lover of hi countri would bring himself to tear in piec hi own nurs and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriv the conquer of their harvest but still thei would have the idea of peac in their heart and would not mean to go on fight for ever ye he said that is a better temper than the other and will not the citi which you ar found be an hellen citi it ought to be he repli then will not the citizen be good and civil ye veri civil and will thei not be lover of hella and think of hella as their own land and share in the common templ most certainli and ani differ which aris among them will be regard by them as discord onlya quarrel among friend which is not to be call a war certainli not then thei will quarrel as those who intend some dai to be reconcil certainli thei will us friendli correct but will not enslav or destroi their oppon thei will be corrector not enemi just so and as thei ar hellen themselv thei will not devast hella nor will thei burn hous nor ever suppos that the whole popul of a citymen women and childrenar equal their enemi for thei know that the guilt of war is alwai confin to a few person and that the mani ar their friend and for all these reason thei will be unwil to wast their land and rase their hous their enmiti to them will onli last until the mani innoc suffer have compel the guilti few to give satisfact i agre he said that our citizen should thu deal with their hellen enemi and with barbarian as the hellen now deal with on anoth then let us enact thi law also for our guardiansthat thei ar neither to devast the land of hellen nor to burn their hous agre and we mai agre also in think that these like all our previou enact ar veri good but still i must sai socrat that if you ar allow to go on in thi wai you will entir forget the other question which at the commenc of thi discuss you thrust asidei such an order of thing possibl and how if at all for i am quit readi to acknowledg that the plan which you propos if onli feasibl would do all sort of good to the state i will add what you have omit that your citizen will be the bravest of warrior and will never leav their rank for thei will all know on anoth and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppos the women to join their armi whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemi or as auxiliari in case of need i know that thei will then be absolut invinc and there ar mani domest advantag which might also be mention and which i also fulli acknowledg but as i admit all these advantag and as mani more as you pleas if onli thi state of your were to come into exist we need sai no more about them assum then the exist of the state let us now turn to the question of possibl and wai and meansth rest mai be left if i loiter for a moment you instantli make a raid upon me i said and have no merci i have hardli escap the first and second wave and you seem not to be awar that you ar now bring upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you will be more consider and will acknowledg that some fear and hesit wa natur respect a propos so extraordinari as that which i have now to state and investig the more appeal of thi sort which you make he said the more determin ar we that you shall tell us how such a state is possibl speak out and at onc let me begin by remind you that we found our wai hither in the search after justic and injustic true he repli but what of that i wa onli go to ask whether if we have discov them we ar to requir that the just man should in noth fail of absolut justic or mai we be satisfi with an approxim and the attain in him of a higher degre of justic than is to be found in other men the approxim will be enough we were enquir into the natur of absolut justic and into the charact of the perfectli just and into injustic and the perfectli unjust that we might have an ideal we were to look at these in order that we might judg of our own happi and unhappi accord to the standard which thei exhibit and the degre in which we resembl them but not with ani view of show that thei could exist in fact true he said would a painter be ani the wors becaus after have delin with consumm art an ideal of a perfectli beauti man he wa unabl to show that ani such man could ever have exist he would be none the wors well and were we not creat an ideal of a perfect state to be sure and is our theori a wors theori becaus we ar unabl to prove the possibl of a citi be order in the manner describ sure not he repli that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what condit the possibl is highest i must ask you have thi in view to repeat your former admiss what admiss i want to know whether ideal ar ever fulli realiz in languag doe not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatev a man mai think alwai in the natur of thing fall short of the truth what do you sai i agre then you must not insist on my prove that the actual state will in everi respect coincid with the ideal if we ar onli abl to discov how a citi mai be govern nearli as we propos you will admit that we have discov the possibl which you demand and will be content i am sure that i should be contentedwil not you ye i will let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in state which is the caus of their present maladministr and what is the least chang which will enabl a state to pass into the truer form and let the chang if possibl be of on thing onli or if not of two at ani rate let the chang be as few and slight as possibl certainli he repli i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if onli on chang were made which is not a slight or easi though still a possibl on what is it he said now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the wave yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my word proce i said until philosoph ar king or the king and princ of thi world have the spirit and power of philosophi and polit great and wisdom meet in on and those common natur who pursu either to the exclus of the other ar compel to stand asid citi will never have rest from their evilsnor the human race as i believeand then onli will thi our state have a possibl of life and behold the light of dai such wa the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have utter if it had not seem too extravag for to be convinc that in no other state can there be happi privat or public is inde a hard thing socrat what do you mean i would have you consid that the word which you have utter is on at which numer person and veri respect person too in a figur pull off their coat all in a moment and seiz ani weapon that come to hand will run at you might and main befor you know where you ar intend to do heaven know what and if you dont prepar an answer and put yourself in motion you will be pare by their fine wit and no mistak you got me into the scrape i said and i wa quit right howev i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can onli give you goodwil and good advic and perhap i mai be abl to fit answer to your question better than anotherthat is all and now have such an auxiliari you must do your best to show the unbeliev that you ar right i ought to try i said sinc you offer me such invalu assist and i think that if there is to be a chanc of our escap we must explain to them whom we mean when we sai that philosoph ar to rule in the state then we shall be abl to defend ourselv there will be discov to be some natur who ought to studi philosophi and to be leader in the state and other who ar not born to be philosoph and ar meant to be follow rather than leader then now for a definit he said follow me i said and i hope that i mai in some wai or other be abl to give you a satisfactori explan proce i dare sai that you rememb and therefor i need not remind you that a lover if he is worthi of the name ought to show hi love not to some on part of that which he love but to the whole i realli do not understand and therefor beg of you to assist my memori anoth person i said might fairli repli as you do but a man of pleasur like yourself ought to know that all who ar in the flower of youth do somehow or other rais a pang or emot in a lover breast and ar thought by him to be worthi of hi affection regard is not thi a wai which you have with the fair on ha a snub nose and you prais hi charm face the hooknos of anoth ha you sai a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hook ha the grace of regular the dark visag is manli the fair ar children of the god and as to the sweet honei pale as thei ar call what is the veri name but the invent of a lover who talk in diminut and is not avers to pale if appear on the cheek of youth in a word there is no excus which you will not make and noth which you will not sai in order not to lose a singl flower that bloom in the springtim of youth if you make me an author in matter of love for the sake of the argument i assent and what do you sai of lover of wine do you not see them do the same thei ar glad of ani pretext of drink ani wine veri good and the same is true of ambiti men if thei cannot command an armi thei ar will to command a file and if thei cannot be honour by realli great and import person thei ar glad to be honour by lesser and meaner peoplebut honour of some kind thei must have exactli onc more let me ask doe he who desir ani class of good desir the whole class or a part onli the whole and mai we not sai of the philosoph that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom onli but of the whole ye of the whole and he who dislik learn especi in youth when he ha no power of judg what is good and what is not such an on we maintain not to be a philosoph or a lover of knowledg just as he who refus hi food is not hungri and mai be said to have a bad appetit and not a good on veri true he said wherea he who ha a tast for everi sort of knowledg and who is curiou to learn and is never satisfi mai be justli term a philosoph am i not right glaucon said if curios make a philosoph you will find mani a strang be will have a titl to the name all the lover of sight have a delight in learn and must therefor be includ music amateur too ar a folk strang out of place among philosoph for thei ar the last person in the world who would come to anyth like a philosoph discuss if thei could help while thei run about at the dionysiac festiv as if thei had let out their ear to hear everi choru whether the perform is in town or countrythat make no differencethei ar there now ar we to maintain that all these and ani who have similar tast as well as the professor of quit minor art ar philosoph certainli not i repli thei ar onli an imit he said who then ar the true philosoph those i said who ar lover of the vision of truth that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean to anoth i repli i might have a difficulti in explain but i am sure that you will admit a proposit which i am about to make what is the proposit that sinc beauti is the opposit of ugli thei ar two certainli and inasmuch as thei ar two each of them is on true again and of just and unjust good and evil and of everi other class the same remark hold taken singli each of them is on but from the variou combin of them with action and thing and with on anoth thei ar seen in all sort of light and appear mani veri true and thi is the distinct which i draw between the sightlov artlov practic class and those of whom i am speak and who ar alon worthi of the name of philosoph how do you distinguish them he said the lover of sound and sight i repli ar as i conceiv fond of fine tone and colour and form and all the artifici product that ar made out of them but their mind is incap of see or love absolut beauti true he repli few ar thei who ar abl to attain to the sight of thi veri true and he who have a sens of beauti thing ha no sens of absolut beauti or who if anoth lead him to a knowledg of that beauti is unabl to followof such an on i ask is he awak or in a dream onli reflect is not the dreamer sleep or wake on who liken dissimilar thing who put the copi in the place of the real object i should certainli sai that such an on wa dream but take the case of the other who recognis the exist of absolut beauti and is abl to distinguish the idea from the object which particip in the idea neither put the object in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objectsi he a dreamer or is he awak he is wide awak and mai we not sai that the mind of the on who know ha knowledg and that the mind of the other who opin onli ha opinion certainli but suppos that the latter should quarrel with us and disput our statement can we administ ani sooth cordial or advic to him without reveal to him that there is sad disord in hi wit we must certainli offer him some good advic he repli come then and let us think of someth to sai to him shall we begin by assur him that he is welcom to ani knowledg which he mai have and that we ar rejoic at hi have it but we should like to ask him a question doe he who ha knowledg know someth or noth you must answer for him i answer that he know someth someth that is or is not someth that is for how can that which is not ever be known and ar we assur after look at the matter from mani point of view that absolut be is or mai be absolut known but that the utterli nonexist is utterli unknown noth can be more certain good but if there be anyth which is of such a natur as to be and not to be that will have a place intermedi between pure be and the absolut negat of be ye between them and as knowledg correspond to be and ignor of necess to notb for that intermedi between be and notb there ha to be discov a correspond intermedi between ignor and knowledg if there be such certainli do we admit the exist of opinion undoubtedli as be the same with knowledg or anoth faculti anoth faculti then opinion and knowledg have to do with differ kind of matter correspond to thi differ of faculti ye and knowledg is rel to be and know be but befor i proce further i will make a divis what divis i will begin by place faculti in a class by themselv thei ar power in us and in all other thing by which we do as we do sight and hear for exampl i should call faculti have i clearli explain the class which i mean ye i quit understand then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and therefor the distinct of figur colour and the like which enabl me to discern the differ of some thing do not appli to them in speak of a faculti i think onli of it sphere and it result and that which ha the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculti but that which ha anoth sphere and anoth result i call differ would that be your wai of speak ye and will you be so veri good as to answer on more question would you sai that knowledg is a faculti or in what class would you place it certainli knowledg is a faculti and the mightiest of all faculti and is opinion also a faculti certainli he said for opinion is that with which we ar abl to form an opinion and yet you were acknowledg a littl while ago that knowledg is not the same as opinion why ye he said how can ani reason be ever identifi that which is infal with that which err an excel answer prove i said that we ar quit consciou of a distinct between them ye then knowledg and opinion have distinct power have also distinct sphere or subjectmatt that is certain be is the sphere or subjectmatt of knowledg and knowledg is to know the natur of be ye and opinion is to have an opinion ye and do we know what we opin or is the subjectmatt of opinion the same as the subjectmatt of knowledg nai he repli that ha been alreadi disproven if differ in faculti impli differ in the sphere or subjectmatt and if as we were sai opinion and knowledg ar distinct faculti then the sphere of knowledg and of opinion cannot be the same then if be is the subjectmatt of knowledg someth els must be the subjectmatt of opinion ye someth els well then is notb the subjectmatt of opinion or rather how can there be an opinion at all about notb reflect when a man ha an opinion ha he not an opinion about someth can he have an opinion which is an opinion about noth imposs he who ha an opinion ha an opinion about some on thing ye and notb is not on thing but properli speak noth true of notb ignor wa assum to be the necessari correl of be knowledg true he said then opinion is not concern either with be or with notb not with either and can therefor neither be ignor nor knowledg that seem to be true but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clear than knowledg or in a greater dark than ignor in neither then i suppos that opinion appear to you to be darker than knowledg but lighter than ignor both and in no small degre and also to be within and between them ye then you would infer that opinion is intermedi no question but were we not sai befor that if anyth appear to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interv between pure be and absolut notb and that the correspond faculti is neither knowledg nor ignor but will be found in the interv between them true and in that interv there ha now been discov someth which we call opinion there ha then what remain to be discov is the object which partak equal of the natur of be and notb and cannot rightli be term either pure and simpl thi unknown term when discov we mai truli call the subject of opinion and assign each to their proper facultyth extrem to the faculti of the extrem and the mean to the faculti of the mean true thi be premis i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolut or unchang idea of beautyin whose opinion the beauti is the manifoldh i sai your lover of beauti sight who cannot bear to be told that the beauti is on and the just is on or that anyth is oneto him i would appeal sai will you be so veri kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beauti thing there is on which will not be found ugli or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holi which will not also be unholi no he repli the beauti will in some point of view be found ugli and the same is true of the rest and mai not the mani which ar doubl be also halvesdoubl that is of on thing and halv of anoth quit true and thing great and small heavi and light as thei ar term will not be denot by these ani more than by the opposit name true both these and the opposit name will alwai attach to all of them and can ani on of those mani thing which ar call by particular name be said to be thi rather than not to be thi he repli thei ar like the pun riddl which ar ask at feast or the children puzzl about the eunuch aim at the bat with what he hit him as thei sai in the puzzl and upon what the bat wa sit the individu object of which i am speak ar also a riddl and have a doubl sens nor can you fix them in your mind either as be or notb or both or neither then what will you do with them i said can thei have a better place than between be and notb for thei ar clearli not in greater dark or negat than notb or more full of light and exist than be that is quit true he said thu then we seem to have discov that the mani idea which the multitud entertain about the beauti and about all other thing ar toss about in some region which is halfwai between pure be and pure notb we have ye and we had befor agre that anyth of thi kind which we might find wa to be describ as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledg be the intermedi flux which is caught and detain by the intermedi faculti quit true then those who see the mani beauti and who yet neither see absolut beauti nor can follow ani guid who point the wai thither who see the mani just and not absolut justic and the likesuch person mai be said to have opinion but not knowledg that is certain but those who see the absolut and etern and immut mai be said to know and not to have opinion onli neither can that be deni the on love and embrac the subject of knowledg the other those of opinion the latter ar the same as i dare sai you will rememb who listen to sweet sound and gaze upon fair colour but would not toler the exist of absolut beauti ye i rememb shall we then be guilti of ani improprieti in call them lover of opinion rather than lover of wisdom and will thei be veri angri with us for thu describ them i shall tell them not to be angri no man should be angri at what is true but those who love the truth in each thing ar to be call lover of wisdom and not lover of opinion assuredli book vi and thu glaucon after the argument ha gone a weari wai the true and the fals philosoph have at length appear in view i do not think he said that the wai could have been shorten i suppos not i said and yet i believ that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discuss could have been confin to thi on subject and if there were not mani other question await us which he who desir to see in what respect the life of the just differ from that of the unjust must consid and what is the next question he ask sure i said the on which follow next in order inasmuch as philosoph onli ar abl to grasp the etern and unchang and those who wander in the region of the mani and variabl ar not philosoph i must ask you which of the two class should be the ruler of our state and how can we rightli answer that question whichev of the two ar best abl to guard the law and institut of our statelet them be our guardian veri good neither i said can there be ani question that the guardian who is to keep anyth should have ey rather than no ey there can be no question of that and ar not those who ar verili and inde want in the knowledg of the true be of each thing and who have in their soul no clear pattern and ar unabl as with a painter ey to look at the absolut truth and to that origin to repair and have perfect vision of the other world to order the law about beauti good justic in thi if not alreadi order and to guard and preserv the order of themar not such person i ask simpli blind truli he repli thei ar much in that condit and shall thei be our guardian when there ar other who besid be their equal in experi and fall short of them in no particular of virtu also know the veri truth of each thing there can be no reason he said for reject those who have thi greatest of all great qualiti thei must alwai have the first place unless thei fail in some other respect suppos then i said that we determin how far thei can unit thi and the other excel by all mean in the first place as we began by observ the natur of the philosoph ha to be ascertain we must come to an understand about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledg that such an union of qualiti is possibl and that those in whom thei ar unit and those onli should be ruler in the state what do you mean let us suppos that philosoph mind alwai love knowledg of a sort which show them the etern natur not vari from gener and corrupt agre and further i said let us agre that thei ar lover of all true be there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honour which thei ar will to renounc as we said befor of the lover and the man of ambit true and if thei ar to be what we were describ is there not anoth qualiti which thei should also possess what qualiti truth thei will never intention receiv into their mind falsehood which is their detest and thei will love the truth ye that mai be safe affirm of them mai be my friend i repli is not the word sai rather must be affirm for he whose natur is amor of anyth cannot help love all that belong or is akin to the object of hi affect right he said and is there anyth more akin to wisdom than truth how can there be can the same natur be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood never the true lover of learn then must from hi earliest youth as far as in him li desir all truth assuredli but then again as we know by experi he whose desir ar strong in on direct will have them weaker in other thei will be like a stream which ha been drawn off into anoth channel true he whose desir ar drawn toward knowledg in everi form will be absorb in the pleasur of the soul and will hardli feel bodili pleasurei mean if he be a true philosoph and not a sham on that is most certain such an on is sure to be temper and the revers of covet for the motiv which make anoth man desir of have and spend have no place in hi charact veri true anoth criterion of the philosoph natur ha also to be consid what is that there should be no secret corner of illiber noth can be more antagonist than mean to a soul which is ever long after the whole of thing both divin and human most true he repli then how can he who ha magnific of mind and is the spectat of all time and all exist think much of human life he cannot or can such an on account death fear no inde then the cowardli and mean natur ha no part in true philosophi certainli not or again can he who is harmoni constitut who is not covet or mean or a boaster or a cowardcan he i sai ever be unjust or hard in hi deal imposs then you will soon observ whether a man is just and gentl or rude and unsoci these ar the sign which distinguish even in youth the philosoph natur from the unphilosoph true there is anoth point which should be remark what point whether he ha or ha not a pleasur in learn for no on will love that which give him pain and in which after much toil he make littl progress certainli not and again if he is forget and retain noth of what he learn will he not be an empti vessel that is certain labour in vain he must end in hate himself and hi fruitless occup ye then a soul which forget cannot be rank among genuin philosoph natur we must insist that the philosoph should have a good memori certainli and onc more the inharmoni and unseemli natur can onli tend to disproport undoubtedli and do you consid truth to be akin to proport or to disproport to proport then besid other qualiti we must try to find a natur wellproport and graciou mind which will move spontan toward the true be of everyth certainli well and do not all these qualiti which we have been enumer go togeth and ar thei not in a manner necessari to a soul which is to have a full and perfect particip of be thei ar absolut necessari he repli and must not that be a blameless studi which he onli can pursu who ha the gift of a good memori and is quick to learnnobl graciou the friend of truth justic courag temper who ar hi kindr the god of jealousi himself he said could find no fault with such a studi and to men like him i said when perfect by year and educ and to these onli you will entrust the state here adeimantu interpos and said to these statement socrat no on can offer a repli but when you talk in thi wai a strang feel pass over the mind of your hearer thei fanci that thei ar led astrai a littl at each step in the argument ow to their own want of skill in ask and answer question these littl accumul and at the end of the discuss thei ar found to have sustain a mighti overthrow and all their former notion appear to be turn upsid down and as unskil player of draught ar at last shut up by their more skil adversari and have no piec to move so thei too find themselv shut up at last for thei have noth to sai in thi new game of which word ar the counter and yet all the time thei ar in the right the observ is suggest to me by what is now occur for ani on of us might sai that although in word he is not abl to meet you at each step of the argument he see as a fact that the votari of philosophi when thei carri on the studi not onli in youth as a part of educ but as the pursuit of their matur year most of them becom strang monster not to sai utter rogu and that those who mai be consid the best of them ar made useless to the world by the veri studi which you extol well and do you think that those who sai so ar wrong i cannot tell he repli but i should like to know what is your opinion hear my answer i am of opinion that thei ar quit right then how can you be justifi in sai that citi will not ceas from evil until philosoph rule in them when philosoph ar acknowledg by us to be of no us to them you ask a question i said to which a repli can onli be given in a parabl ye socrat and that is a wai of speak to which you ar not at all accustom i suppos i perceiv i said that you ar vastli amus at have plung me into such a hopeless discuss but now hear the parabl and then you will be still more amus at the meagr of my imagin for the manner in which the best men ar treat in their own state is so grievou that no singl thing on earth is compar to it and therefor if i am to plead their caus i must have recours to fiction and put togeth a figur made up of mani thing like the fabul union of goat and stag which ar found in pictur imagin then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than ani of the crew but he is a littl deaf and ha a similar infirm in sight and hi knowledg of navig is not much better the sailor ar quarrel with on anoth about the steeringeveri on is of opinion that he ha a right to steer though he ha never learn the art of navig and cannot tell who taught him or when he learn and will further assert that it cannot be taught and thei ar readi to cut in piec ani on who sai the contrari thei throng about the captain beg and prai him to commit the helm to them and if at ani time thei do not prevail but other ar prefer to them thei kill the other or throw them overboard and have first chain up the nobl captain sens with drink or some narcot drug thei mutini and take possess of the ship and make free with the store thu eat and drink thei proce on their voyag in such manner as might be expect of them him who is their partisan and cleverli aid them in their plot for get the ship out of the captain hand into their own whether by forc or persuas thei compliment with the name of sailor pilot abl seaman and abus the other sort of man whom thei call a goodfornoth but that the true pilot must pai attent to the year and season and sky and star and wind and whatev els belong to hi art if he intend to be realli qualifi for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other peopl like or notth possibl of thi union of author with the steerer art ha never serious enter into their thought or been made part of their call now in vessel which ar in a state of mutini and by sailor who ar mutin how will the true pilot be regard will he not be call by them a prater a stargaz a goodfornoth of cours said adeimantu then you will hardli need i said to hear the interpret of the figur which describ the true philosoph in hi relat to the state for you understand alreadi certainli then suppos you now take thi parabl to the gentleman who is surpris at find that philosoph have no honour in their citi explain it to him and try to convinc him that their have honour would be far more extraordinari i will sai to him that in deem the best votari of philosophi to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribut their useless to the fault of those who will not us them and not to themselv the pilot should not humbl beg the sailor to be command by himthat is not the order of natur neither ar the wise to go to the door of the richth ingeni author of thi sai told a liebut the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who want to be govern to him who is abl to govern the ruler who is good for anyth ought not to beg hi subject to be rule by him although the present governor of mankind ar of a differ stamp thei mai be justli compar to the mutin sailor and the true helmsmen to those who ar call by them goodfornoth and stargaz precis so he said for these reason and among men like these philosophi the noblest pursuit of all is not like to be much esteem by those of the opposit faction not that the greatest and most last injuri is done to her by her oppon but by her own profess follow the same of whom you suppos the accus to sai that the greater number of them ar arrant rogu and the best ar useless in which opinion i agre ye and the reason why the good ar useless ha now been explain true then shall we proce to show that the corrupt of the major is also unavoid and that thi is not to be laid to the charg of philosophi ani more than the other by all mean and let us ask and answer in turn first go back to the descript of the gentl and nobl natur truth as you will rememb wa hi leader whom he follow alwai and in all thing fail in thi he wa an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophi ye that wa said well and is not thi on qualiti to mention no other greatli at varianc with present notion of him certainli he said and have we not a right to sai in hi defenc that the true lover of knowledg is alwai strive after beingthat is hi natur he will not rest in the multipl of individu which is an appear onli but will go onth keen edg will not be blunt nor the forc of hi desir abat until he have attain the knowledg of the true natur of everi essenc by a sympathet and kindr power in the soul and by that power draw near and mingl and becom incorpor with veri be have begotten mind and truth he will have knowledg and will live and grow truli and then and not till then will he ceas from hi travail noth he said can be more just than such a descript of him and will the love of a lie be ani part of a philosoph natur will he not utterli hate a lie he will and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect ani evil of the band which he lead imposs justic and health of mind will be of the compani and temper will follow after true he repli neither is there ani reason why i should again set in arrai the philosoph virtu as you will doubtless rememb that courag magnific apprehens memori were hi natur gift and you object that although no on could deni what i then said still if you leav word and look at fact the person who ar thu describ ar some of them manifestli useless and the greater number utterli deprav we were then led to enquir into the ground of these accus and have now arriv at the point of ask why ar the major bad which question of necess brought us back to the examin and definit of the true philosoph exactli and we have next to consid the corrupt of the philosoph natur why so mani ar spoil and so few escap spoilingi am speak of those who were said to be useless but not wickedand when we have done with them we will speak of the imit of philosophi what manner of men ar thei who aspir after a profess which is abov them and of which thei ar unworthi and then by their manifold inconsist bring upon philosophi and upon all philosoph that univers reprob of which we speak what ar these corrupt he said i will see if i can explain them to you everi on will admit that a natur have in perfect all the qualiti which we requir in a philosoph is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men rare inde and what numberless and power caus tend to destroi these rare natur what caus in the first place there ar their own virtu their courag temper and the rest of them everi on of which praiseworthi qualiti and thi is a most singular circumst destroi and distract from philosophi the soul which is the possessor of them that is veri singular he repli then there ar all the ordinari good of lifebeauti wealth strength rank and great connect in the statey understand the sort of thingsthes also have a corrupt and distract effect i understand but i should like to know more precis what you mean about them grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right wai you will then have no difficulti in apprehend the preced remark and thei will no longer appear strang to you and how am i to do so he ask why i said we know that all germ or seed whether veget or anim when thei fail to meet with proper nutriment or climat or soil in proport to their vigour ar all the more sensit to the want of a suitabl environ for evil is a greater enemi to what is good than to what is not veri true there is reason in suppos that the finest natur when under alien condit receiv more injuri than the inferior becaus the contrast is greater certainli and mai we not sai adeimantu that the most gift mind when thei ar illeduc becom preemin bad do not great crime and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a ful of natur ruin by educ rather than from ani inferior wherea weak natur ar scarc capabl of ani veri great good or veri great evil there i think that you ar right and our philosoph follow the same analogyh is like a plant which have proper nurtur must necessarili grow and matur into all virtu but if sown and plant in an alien soil becom the most noxiou of all weed unless he be preserv by some divin power do you realli think as peopl so often sai that our youth ar corrupt by sophist or that privat teacher of the art corrupt them in ani degre worth speak of ar not the public who sai these thing the greatest of all sophist and do thei not educ to perfect young and old men and women alik and fashion them after their own heart when is thi accomplish he said when thei meet togeth and the world sit down at an assembl or in a court of law or a theatr or a camp or in ani other popular resort and there is a great uproar and thei prais some thing which ar be said or done and blame other thing equal exagger both shout and clap their hand and the echo of the rock and the place in which thei ar assembl redoubl the sound of the prais or blameat such a time will not a young man heart as thei sai leap within him will ani privat train enabl him to stand firm against the overwhelm flood of popular opinion or will he be carri awai by the stream will he not have the notion of good and evil which the public in gener haveh will do as thei do and as thei ar such will he be ye socrat necess will compel him and yet i said there is a still greater necess which ha not been mention what is that the gentl forc of attaind or confisc or death which as you ar awar these new sophist and educ who ar the public appli when their word ar powerless inde thei do and in right good earnest now what opinion of ani other sophist or of ani privat person can be expect to overcom in such an unequ contest none he repli no inde i said even to make the attempt is a great piec of folli there neither is nor ha been nor is ever like to be ani differ type of charact which ha had no other train in virtu but that which is suppli by public opinioni speak my friend of human virtu onli what is more than human as the proverb sai is not includ for i would not have you ignor that in the present evil state of govern whatev is save and come to good is save by the power of god as we mai truli sai i quit assent he repli then let me crave your assent also to a further observ what ar you go to sai why that all those mercenari individu whom the mani call sophist and whom thei deem to be their adversari do in fact teach noth but the opinion of the mani that is to sai the opinion of their assembl and thi is their wisdom i might compar them to a man who should studi the temper and desir of a mighti strong beast who is fed by himh would learn how to approach and handl him also at what time and from what caus he is danger or the revers and what is the mean of hi sever cri and by what sound when anoth utter them he is sooth or infuri and you mai suppos further that when by continu attend upon him he ha becom perfect in all thi he call hi knowledg wisdom and make of it a system or art which he proce to teach although he ha no real notion of what he mean by the principl or passion of which he is speak but call thi honour and that dishonour or good or evil or just or unjust all in accord with the tast and temper of the great brute good he pronounc to be that in which the beast delight and evil to be that which he dislik and he can give no other account of them except that the just and nobl ar the necessari have never himself seen and have no power of explain to other the natur of either or the differ between them which is immens by heaven would not such an on be a rare educ inde he would and in what wai doe he who think that wisdom is the discern of the temper and tast of the motlei multitud whether in paint or music or final in polit differ from him whom i have been describ for when a man consort with the mani and exhibit to them hi poem or other work of art or the servic which he ha done the state make them hi judg when he is not oblig the socal necess of diomed will oblig him to produc whatev thei prais and yet the reason ar utterli ludicr which thei give in confirm of their own notion about the honour and good did you ever hear ani of them which were not no nor am i like to hear you recognis the truth of what i have been sai then let me ask you to consid further whether the world will ever be induc to believ in the exist of absolut beauti rather than of the mani beauti or of the absolut in each kind rather than of the mani in each kind certainli not then the world cannot possibl be a philosoph imposs and therefor philosoph must inevit fall under the censur of the world thei must and of individu who consort with the mob and seek to pleas them that is evid then do you see ani wai in which the philosoph can be preserv in hi call to the end and rememb what we were sai of him that he wa to have quick and memori and courag and magnificencethes were admit by us to be the true philosoph gift ye will not such an on from hi earli childhood be in all thing first among all especi if hi bodili endow ar like hi mental on certainli he said and hi friend and fellowcitizen will want to us him as he get older for their own purpos no question fall at hi feet thei will make request to him and do him honour and flatter him becaus thei want to get into their hand now the power which he will on dai possess that often happen he said and what will a man such as he is be like to do under such circumst especi if he be a citizen of a great citi rich and nobl and a tall proper youth will he not be full of boundless aspir and fanci himself abl to manag the affair of hellen and of barbarian and have got such notion into hi head will he not dilat and elev himself in the ful of vain pomp and senseless pride to be sure he will now when he is in thi state of mind if some on gentli come to him and tell him that he is a fool and must get understand which can onli be got by slave for it do you think that under such advers circumst he will be easili induc to listen far otherwis and even if there be some on who through inher good or natur reason ha had hi ey open a littl and is humbl and taken captiv by philosophi how will hi friend behav when thei think that thei ar like to lose the advantag which thei were hope to reap from hi companionship will thei not do and sai anyth to prevent him from yield to hi better natur and to render hi teacher powerless us to thi end privat intrigu as well as public prosecut there can be no doubt of it and how can on who is thu circumstanc ever becom a philosoph imposs then were we not right in sai that even the veri qualiti which make a man a philosoph mai if he be illeduc divert him from philosophi no less than rich and their accompani and the other socal good of life we were quit right thu my excel friend is brought about all that ruin and failur which i have been describ of the natur best adapt to the best of all pursuit thei ar natur which we maintain to be rare at ani time thi be the class out of which come the men who ar the author of the greatest evil to state and individu and also of the greatest good when the tide carri them in that direct but a small man never wa the doer of ani great thing either to individu or to state that is most true he said and so philosophi is left desol with her marriag rite incomplet for her own have fallen awai and forsaken her and while thei ar lead a fals and unbecom life other unworthi person see that she ha no kinsmen to be her protector enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproach which as you sai her reprov utter who affirm of her votari that some ar good for noth and that the greater number deserv the severest punish that is certainli what peopl sai ye and what els would you expect i said when you think of the puni creatur who see thi land open to thema land well stock with fair name and showi titleslik prison run out of prison into a sanctuari take a leap out of their trade into philosophi those who do so be probabl the cleverest hand at their own miser craft for although philosophi be in thi evil case still there remain a digniti about her which is not to be found in the art and mani ar thu attract by her whose natur ar imperfect and whose soul ar maim and disfigur by their mean as their bodi ar by their trade and craft is not thi unavoid ye ar thei not exactli like a bald littl tinker who ha just got out of duranc and come into a fortun he take a bath and put on a new coat and is deck out as a bridegroom go to marri hi master daughter who is left poor and desol a most exact parallel what will be the issu of such marriag will thei not be vile and bastard there can be no question of it and when person who ar unworthi of educ approach philosophi and make an allianc with her who is in a rank abov them what sort of idea and opinion ar like to be gener will thei not be sophism captiv to the ear have noth in them genuin or worthi of or akin to true wisdom no doubt he said then adeimantu i said the worthi discipl of philosophi will be but a small remnant perchanc some nobl and welleduc person detain by exil in her servic who in the absenc of corrupt influenc remain devot to her or some lofti soul born in a mean citi the polit of which he contemn and neglect and there mai be a gift few who leav the art which thei justli despis and come to heror peradventur there ar some who ar restrain by our friend theag bridl for everyth in the life of theag conspir to divert him from philosophi but illhealth kept him awai from polit my own case of the intern sign is hardli worth mention for rare if ever ha such a monitor been given to ani other man those who belong to thi small class have tast how sweet and bless a possess philosophi is and have also seen enough of the mad of the multitud and thei know that no politician is honest nor is there ani champion of justic at whose side thei mai fight and be save such an on mai be compar to a man who ha fallen among wild beastsh will not join in the wicked of hi fellow but neither is he abl singli to resist all their fierc natur and therefor see that he would be of no us to the state or to hi friend and reflect that he would have to throw awai hi life without do ani good either to himself or other he hold hi peac and goe hi own wai he is like on who in the storm of dust and sleet which the drive wind hurri along retir under the shelter of a wall and see the rest of mankind full of wicked he is content if onli he can live hi own life and be pure from evil or unright and depart in peac and goodwil with bright hope ye he said and he will have done a great work befor he depart a great worky but not the greatest unless he find a state suitabl to him for in a state which is suitabl to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of hi countri as well as of himself the caus why philosophi is in such an evil name have now been suffici explain the injustic of the charg against her ha been showni there anyth more which you wish to sai noth more on that subject he repli but i should like to know which of the govern now exist is in your opinion the on adapt to her not ani of them i said and that is precis the accus which i bring against themnot on of them is worthi of the philosoph natur and henc that natur is warp and estrangeda the exot seed which is sown in a foreign land becom denatur and is wont to be overpow and to lose itself in the new soil even so thi growth of philosophi instead of persist degener and receiv anoth charact but if philosophi ever find in the state that perfect which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divin and that all other thing whether natur of men or institut ar but humanand now i know that you ar go to ask what that state is no he said there you ar wrong for i wa go to ask anoth questionwheth it is the state of which we ar the founder and inventor or some other ye i repli our in most respect but you mai rememb my sai befor that some live author would alwai be requir in the state have the same idea of the constitut which guid you when as legisl you were lai down the law that wa said he repli ye but not in a satisfactori manner you frighten us by interpos object which certainli show that the discuss would be long and difficult and what still remain is the revers of easi what is there remain the question how the studi of philosophi mai be so order as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempt ar attend with risk hard is the good as men sai still he said let the point be clear up and the enquiri will then be complet i shall not be hinder i said by ani want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you mai see for yourselv and pleas to remark in what i am about to sai how boldli and unhesitatingli i declar that state should pursu philosophi not as thei do now but in a differ spirit in what manner at present i said the student of philosophi ar quit young begin when thei ar hardli past childhood thei devot onli the time save from moneymak and housekeep to such pursuit and even those of them who ar reput to have most of the philosoph spirit when thei come within sight of the great difficulti of the subject i mean dialect take themselv off in after life when invit by some on els thei mai perhap go and hear a lectur and about thi thei make much ado for philosophi is not consid by them to be their proper busi at last when thei grow old in most case thei ar extinguish more truli than heracleitu sun inasmuch as thei never light up again heraclitu said that the sun wa extinguish everi even and relight everi morn but what ought to be their cours just the opposit in childhood and youth their studi and what philosophi thei learn should be suit to their tender year dure thi period while thei ar grow up toward manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodi that thei mai have them to us in the servic of philosophi as life advanc and the intellect begin to matur let them increas the gymnast of the soul but when the strength of our citizen fail and is past civil and militari duti then let them rang at will and engag in no seriou labour as we intend them to live happili here and to crown thi life with a similar happi in anoth how truli in earnest you ar socrat he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearer if i am not mistaken ar like to be still more earnest in their opposit to you and will never be convinc thrasymachu least of all do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachu and me who have recent becom friend although inde we were never enemi for i shall go on strive to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do someth which mai profit them against the dai when thei live again and hold the like discours in anoth state of exist you ar speak of a time which is not veri near rather i repli of a time which is as noth in comparison with etern nevertheless i do not wonder that the mani refus to believ for thei have never seen that of which we ar now speak realiz thei have seen onli a convent imit of philosophi consist of word artifici brought togeth not like these of our have a natur uniti but a human be who in word and work is perfectli mould as far as he can be into the proport and like of virtuesuch a man rule in a citi which bear the same imag thei have never yet seen neither on nor mani of themdo you think that thei ever did no inde no my friend and thei have seldom if ever heard free and nobl sentiment such as men utter when thei ar earnestli and by everi mean in their power seek after truth for the sake of knowledg while thei look coldli on the subtleti of controversi of which the end is opinion and strife whether thei meet with them in the court of law or in societi thei ar stranger he said to the word of which you speak and thi wa what we foresaw and thi wa the reason why truth forc us to admit not without fear and hesit that neither citi nor state nor individu will ever attain perfect until the small class of philosoph whom we term useless but not corrupt ar providenti compel whether thei will or not to take care of the state and until a like necess be laid on the state to obei them or until king or if not king the son of king or princ ar divin inspir with a true love of true philosophi that either or both of these altern ar imposs i see no reason to affirm if thei were so we might inde be justli ridicul as dreamer and visionari am i not right quit right if then in the countless ag of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far awai and beyond our ken the perfect philosoph is or ha been or hereaft shall be compel by a superior power to have the charg of the state we ar readi to assert to the death that thi our constitut ha been and isyea and will be whenev the muse of philosophi is queen there is no imposs in all thi that there is a difficulti we acknowledg ourselv my opinion agre with your he said but do you mean to sai that thi is not the opinion of the multitud i should imagin not he repli o my friend i said do not attack the multitud thei will chang their mind if not in an aggress spirit but gentli and with the view of sooth them and remov their dislik of overeduc you show them your philosoph as thei realli ar and describ as you were just now do their charact and profess and then mankind will see that he of whom you ar speak is not such as thei supposedif thei view him in thi new light thei will sure chang their notion of him and answer in anoth strain who can be at enmiti with on who love them who that is himself gentl and free from envi will be jealou of on in whom there is no jealousi nai let me answer for you that in a few thi harsh temper mai be found but not in the major of mankind i quit agre with you he said and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feel which the mani entertain toward philosophi origin in the pretend who rush in uninvit and ar alwai abus them and find fault with them who make person instead of thing the theme of their convers and noth can be more unbecom in philosoph than thi it is most unbecom for he adeimantu whose mind is fix upon true be ha sure no time to look down upon the affair of earth or to be fill with malic and envi contend against men hi ey is ever direct toward thing fix and immut which he see neither injur nor injur by on anoth but all in order move accord to reason these he imit and to these he will as far as he can conform himself can a man help imit that with which he hold reverenti convers imposs and the philosoph hold convers with the divin order becom orderli and divin as far as the natur of man allow but like everi on els he will suffer from detract of cours and if a necess be laid upon him of fashion not onli himself but human natur gener whether in state or individu into that which he behold elsewher will he think you be an unskil artific of justic temper and everi civil virtu anyth but unskil and if the world perceiv that what we ar sai about him is the truth will thei be angri with philosophi will thei disbeliev us when we tell them that no state can be happi which is not design by artist who imit the heavenli pattern thei will not be angri if thei understand he said but how will thei draw out the plan of which you ar speak thei will begin by take the state and the manner of men from which as from a tablet thei will rub out the pictur and leav a clean surfac thi is no easi task but whether easi or not herein will lie the differ between them and everi other legislatorthei will have noth to do either with individu or state and will inscrib no law until thei have either found or themselv made a clean surfac thei will be veri right he said have effect thi thei will proce to trace an outlin of the constitut no doubt and when thei ar fill in the work as i conceiv thei will often turn their ey upward and downward i mean that thei will first look at absolut justic and beauti and temper and again at the human copi and will mingl and temper the variou element of life into the imag of a man and thi thei will conceiv accord to that other imag which when exist among men homer call the form and like of god veri true he said and on featur thei will eras and anoth thei will put in until thei have made the wai of men as far as possibl agreeabl to the wai of god inde he said in no wai could thei make a fairer pictur and now i said ar we begin to persuad those whom you describ as rush at us with might and main that the painter of constitut is such an on as we ar prais at whom thei were so veri indign becaus to hi hand we commit the state and ar thei grow a littl calmer at what thei have just heard much calmer if there is ani sens in them why where can thei still find ani ground for object will thei doubt that the philosoph is a lover of truth and be thei would not be so unreason or that hi natur be such as we have delin is akin to the highest good neither can thei doubt thi but again will thei tell us that such a natur place under favour circumst will not be perfectli good and wise if ani ever wa or will thei prefer those whom we have reject sure not then will thei still be angri at our sai that until philosoph bear rule state and individu will have no rest from evil nor will thi our imaginari state ever be realiz i think that thei will be less angri shall we assum that thei ar not onli less angri but quit gentl and that thei have been convert and for veri shame if for no other reason cannot refus to come to term by all mean he said then let us suppos that the reconcili ha been effect will ani on deni the other point that there mai be son of king or princ who ar by natur philosoph sure no man he said and when thei have come into be will ani on sai that thei must of necess be destroi that thei can hardli be save is not deni even by us but that in the whole cours of ag no singl on of them can escapewho will ventur to affirm thi who inde but said i on is enough let there be on man who ha a citi obedi to hi will and he might bring into exist the ideal politi about which the world is so incredul ye on is enough the ruler mai impos the law and institut which we have been describ and the citizen mai possibl be will to obei them certainli and that other should approv of what we approv is no miracl or imposs i think not but we have suffici shown in what ha preced that all thi if onli possibl is assuredli for the best we have and now we sai not onli that our law if thei could be enact would be for the best but also that the enact of them though difficult is not imposs veri good and so with pain and toil we have reach the end of on subject but more remain to be discussedhow and by what studi and pursuit will the saviour of the constitut be creat and at what ag ar thei to appli themselv to their sever studi certainli i omit the troublesom busi of the possess of women and the procreat of children and the appoint of the ruler becaus i knew that the perfect state would be ei with jealousi and wa difficult of attain but that piec of clever wa not of much servic to me for i had to discuss them all the same the women and children ar now dispos of but the other question of the ruler must be investig from the veri begin we were sai as you will rememb that thei were to be lover of their countri tri by the test of pleasur and pain and neither in hardship nor in danger nor at ani other critic moment were to lose their patriotismh wa to be reject who fail but he who alwai came forth pure like gold tri in the refin fire wa to be made a ruler and to receiv honour and reward in life and after death thi wa the sort of thing which wa be said and then the argument turn asid and veil her face not like to stir the question which ha now arisen i perfectli rememb he said ye my friend i said and i then shrank from hazard the bold word but now let me dare to saythat the perfect guardian must be a philosoph ye he said let that be affirm and do not suppos that there will be mani of them for the gift which were deem by us to be essenti rare grow togeth thei ar mostli found in shred and patch what do you mean he said you ar awar i repli that quick intellig memori sagac clever and similar qualiti do not often grow togeth and that person who possess them and ar at the same time highspirit and magnanim ar not so constitut by natur as to live orderli and in a peac and settl manner thei ar driven ani wai by their impuls and all solid principl goe out of them veri true he said on the other hand those steadfast natur which can better be depend upon which in a battl ar impregn to fear and immov ar equal immov when there is anyth to be learn thei ar alwai in a torpid state and ar apt to yawn and go to sleep over ani intellectu toil quit true and yet we were sai that both qualiti were necessari in those to whom the higher educ is to be impart and who ar to share in ani offic or command certainli he said and will thei be a class which is rare found ye inde then the aspir must not onli be test in those labour and danger and pleasur which we mention befor but there is anoth kind of probat which we did not mentionh must be exercis also in mani kind of knowledg to see whether the soul will be abl to endur the highest of all or will faint under them as in ani other studi and exercis ye he said you ar quit right in test him but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledg you mai rememb i said that we divid the soul into three part and distinguish the sever natur of justic temper courag and wisdom inde he said if i had forgotten i should not deserv to hear more and do you rememb the word of caution which preced the discuss of them to what do you refer we were sai if i am not mistaken that he who want to see them in their perfect beauti must take a longer and more circuit wai at the end of which thei would appear but that we could add on a popular exposit of them on a level with the discuss which had preced and you repli that such an exposit would be enough for you and so the enquiri wa continu in what to me seem to be a veri inaccur manner whether you were satisfi or not it is for you to sai ye he said i thought and the other thought that you gave us a fair measur of truth but my friend i said a measur of such thing which in ani degre fall short of the whole truth is not fair measur for noth imperfect is the measur of anyth although person ar too apt to be content and think that thei need search no further not an uncommon case when peopl ar indol ye i said and there cannot be ani wors fault in a guardian of the state and of the law true the guardian then i said must be requir to take the longer circuit and toil at learn as well as at gymnast or he will never reach the highest knowledg of all which as we were just now sai is hi proper call what he said is there a knowledg still higher than thishigh than justic and the other virtu ye i said there is and of the virtu too we must behold not the outlin mere as at presentnoth short of the most finish pictur should satisfi us when littl thing ar elabor with an infin of pain in order that thei mai appear in their full beauti and utmost clear how ridicul that we should not think the highest truth worthi of attain the highest accuraci a right nobl thought but do you suppos that we shall refrain from ask you what is thi highest knowledg nai i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer mani time and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you ar dispos to be troublesom for you have often been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledg and that all other thing becom us and advantag onli by their us of thi you can hardli be ignor that of thi i wa about to speak concern which as you have often heard me sai we know so littl and without which ani other knowledg or possess of ani kind will profit us noth do you think that the possess of all other thing is of ani valu if we do not possess the good or the knowledg of all other thing if we have no knowledg of beauti and good assuredli not you ar further awar that most peopl affirm pleasur to be the good but the finer sort of wit sai it is knowledg ye and you ar awar too that the latter cannot explain what thei mean by knowledg but ar oblig after all to sai knowledg of the good how ridicul ye i said that thei should begin by reproach us with our ignor of the good and then presum our knowledg of itfor the good thei defin to be knowledg of the good just as if we understood them when thei us the term goodthi is of cours ridicul most true he said and those who make pleasur their good ar in equal perplex for thei ar compel to admit that there ar bad pleasur as well as good certainli and therefor to acknowledg that bad and good ar the same true there can be no doubt about the numer difficulti in which thi question is involv there can be none further do we not see that mani ar will to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honour without the realiti but no on is satisfi with the appear of goodth realiti is what thei seek in the case of the good appear is despis by everi on veri true he said of thi then which everi soul of man pursu and make the end of all hi action have a presenti that there is such an end and yet hesit becaus neither know the natur nor have the same assur of thi as of other thing and therefor lose whatev good there is in other thingsof a principl such and so great as thi ought the best men in our state to whom everyth is entrust to be in the dark of ignor certainli not he said i am sure i said that he who doe not know how the beauti and the just ar likewis good will be but a sorri guardian of them and i suspect that no on who is ignor of the good will have a true knowledg of them that he said is a shrewd suspicion of your and if we onli have a guardian who ha thi knowledg our state will be perfectli order of cours he repli but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceiv thi suprem principl of the good to be knowledg or pleasur or differ from either ay i said i knew all along that a fastidi gentleman like you would not be content with the thought of other peopl about these matter true socrat but i must sai that on who like you ha pass a lifetim in the studi of philosophi should not be alwai repeat the opinion of other and never tell hi own well but ha ani on a right to sai posit what he doe not know not he said with the assur of posit certainti he ha no right to do that but he mai sai what he think as a matter of opinion and do you not know i said that all mere opinion ar bad and the best of them blind you would not deni that those who have ani true notion without intellig ar onli like blind men who feel their wai along the road veri true and do you wish to behold what is blind and crook and base when other will tell you of bright and beauti still i must implor you socrat said glaucon not to turn awai just as you ar reach the goal if you will onli give such an explan of the good as you have alreadi given of justic and temper and the other virtu we shall be satisfi ye my friend and i shall be at least equal satisfi but i cannot help fear that i shall fail and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicul upon me no sweet sir let us not at present ask what is the actual natur of the good for to reach what is now in my thought would be an effort too great for me but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wish to hearotherwis not by all mean he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent i do inde wish i repli that i could pai and you receiv the account of the parent and not as now of the offspr onli take howev thi latter by wai of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a fals account although i have no intent of deceiv you ye we will take all the care that we can proce ye i said but i must first come to an understand with you and remind you of what i have mention in the cours of thi discuss and at mani other time what the old stori that there is a mani beauti and a mani good and so of other thing which we describ and defin to all of them the term mani is appli true he said and there is an absolut beauti and an absolut good and of other thing to which the term mani is appli there is an absolut for thei mai be brought under a singl idea which is call the essenc of each veri true the mani as we sai ar seen but not known and the idea ar known but not seen exactli and what is the organ with which we see the visibl thing the sight he said and with the hear i said we hear and with the other sens perceiv the other object of sens true but have you remark that sight is by far the most costli and complex piec of workmanship which the artific of the sens ever contriv no i never have he said then reflect ha the ear or voic need of ani third or addit natur in order that the on mai be abl to hear and the other to be heard noth of the sort no inde i repli and the same is true of most if not all the other sensesy would not sai that ani of them requir such an addit certainli not but you see that without the addit of some other natur there is no see or be seen how do you mean sight be as i conceiv in the ey and he who ha ey want to see colour be also present in them still unless there be a third natur special adapt to the purpos the owner of the ey will see noth and the colour will be invis of what natur ar you speak of that which you term light i repli true he said nobl then is the bond which link togeth sight and visibl and great beyond other bond by no small differ of natur for light is their bond and light is no ignobl thing nai he said the revers of ignobl and which i said of the god in heaven would you sai wa the lord of thi element whose is that light which make the ey to see perfectli and the visibl to appear you mean the sun as you and all mankind sai mai not the relat of sight to thi deiti be describ as follow how neither sight nor the ey in which sight resid is the sun no yet of all the organ of sens the ey is the most like the sun by far the most like and the power which the ey possess is a sort of effluenc which is dispens from the sun exactli then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognis by sight true he said and thi is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in hi own like to be in the visibl world in relat to sight and the thing of sight what the good is in the intellectu world in relat to mind and the thing of mind will you be a littl more explicit he said why you know i said that the ey when a person direct them toward object on which the light of dai is no longer shine but the moon and star onli see dimli and ar nearli blind thei seem to have no clear of vision in them veri true but when thei ar direct toward object on which the sun shine thei see clearli and there is sight in them certainli and the soul is like the ey when rest upon that on which truth and be shine the soul perceiv and understand and is radiant with intellig but when turn toward the twilight of becom and perish then she ha opinion onli and goe blink about and is first of on opinion and then of anoth and seem to have no intellig just so now that which impart truth to the known and the power of know to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and thi you will deem to be the caus of scienc and of truth in so far as the latter becom the subject of knowledg beauti too as ar both truth and knowledg you will be right in esteem thi other natur as more beauti than either and as in the previou instanc light and sight mai be truli said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in thi other sphere scienc and truth mai be deem to be like the good but not the good the good ha a place of honour yet higher what a wonder of beauti that must be he said which is the author of scienc and truth and yet surpass them in beauti for you sure cannot mean to sai that pleasur is the good god forbid i repli but mai i ask you to consid the imag in anoth point of view in what point of view you would sai would you not that the sun is not onli the author of visibl in all visibl thing but of gener and nourish and growth though he himself is not gener certainli in like manner the good mai be said to be not onli the author of knowledg to all thing known but of their be and essenc and yet the good is not essenc but far exce essenc in digniti and power glaucon said with a ludicr earnest by the light of heaven how amaz ye i said and the exagger mai be set down to you for you made me utter my fanci and prai continu to utter them at ani rate let us hear if there is anyth more to be said about the similitud of the sun ye i said there is a great deal more then omit noth howev slight i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omit i hope not he said you have to imagin then that there ar two rule power and that on of them is set over the intellectu world the other over the visibl i do not sai heaven lest you should fanci that i am plai upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz mai i suppos that you have thi distinct of the visibl and intellig fix in your mind i have now take a line which ha been cut into two unequ part and divid each of them again in the same proport and suppos the two main divis to answer on to the visibl and the other to the intellig and then compar the subdivis in respect of their clear and want of clear and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visibl consist of imag and by imag i mean in the first place shadow and in the second place reflect in water and in solid smooth and polish bodi and the like do you understand ye i understand imagin now the other section of which thi is onli the resembl to includ the anim which we see and everyth that grow or is made veri good would you not admit that both the section of thi divis have differ degre of truth and that the copi is to the origin as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledg most undoubtedli next proce to consid the manner in which the sphere of the intellectu is to be divid in what manner thusther ar two subdivis in the lower of which the soul us the figur given by the former divis as imag the enquiri can onli be hypothet and instead of go upward to a principl descend to the other end in the higher of the two the soul pass out of hypothes and goe up to a principl which is abov hypothes make no us of imag as in the former case but proceed onli in and through the idea themselv i do not quit understand your mean he said then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminari remark you ar awar that student of geometri arithmet and the kindr scienc assum the odd and the even and the figur and three kind of angl and the like in their sever branch of scienc these ar their hypothes which thei and everi bodi ar suppos to know and therefor thei do not deign to give ani account of them either to themselv or other but thei begin with them and go on until thei arriv at last and in a consist manner at their conclus ye he said i know and do you not know also that although thei make us of the visibl form and reason about them thei ar think not of these but of the ideal which thei resembl not of the figur which thei draw but of the absolut squar and the absolut diamet and so onth form which thei draw or make and which have shadow and reflect in water of their own ar convert by them into imag but thei ar realli seek to behold the thing themselv which can onli be seen with the ey of the mind that is true and of thi kind i spoke as the intellig although in the search after it the soul is compel to us hypothes not ascend to a first principl becaus she is unabl to rise abov the region of hypothesi but emploi the object of which the shadow below ar resembl in their turn as imag thei have in relat to the shadow and reflect of them a greater distinct and therefor a higher valu i understand he said that you ar speak of the provinc of geometri and the sister art and when i speak of the other divis of the intellig you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledg which reason herself attain by the power of dialect us the hypothes not as first principl but onli as hypothesesthat is to sai as step and point of departur into a world which is abov hypothes in order that she mai soar beyond them to the first principl of the whole and cling to thi and then to that which depend on thi by success step she descend again without the aid of ani sensibl object from idea through idea and in idea she end i understand you he repli not perfectli for you seem to me to be describ a task which is realli tremend but at ani rate i understand you to sai that knowledg and be which the scienc of dialect contempl ar clearer than the notion of the art as thei ar term which proce from hypothes onli these ar also contempl by the understand and not by the sens yet becaus thei start from hypothes and do not ascend to a principl those who contempl them appear to you not to exercis the higher reason upon them although when a first principl is ad to them thei ar cogniz by the higher reason and the habit which is concern with geometri and the cognat scienc i suppos that you would term understand and not reason as be intermedi between opinion and reason you have quit conceiv my mean i said and now correspond to these four divis let there be four faculti in the soulreason answer to the highest understand to the second faith or convict to the third and percept of shadow to the lastand let there be a scale of them and let us suppos that the sever faculti have clear in the same degre that their object have truth i understand he repli and give my assent and accept your arrang book vii and now i said let me show in a figur how far our natur is enlighten or unenlightenedbehold human be live in a underground den which ha a mouth open toward the light and reach all along the den here thei have been from their childhood and have their leg and neck chain so that thei cannot move and can onli see befor them be prevent by the chain from turn round their head abov and behind them a fire is blaze at a distanc and between the fire and the prison there is a rais wai and you will see if you look a low wall built along the wai like the screen which marionett player have in front of them over which thei show the puppet i see and do you see i said men pass along the wall carri all sort of vessel and statu and figur of anim made of wood and stone and variou materi which appear over the wall some of them ar talk other silent you have shown me a strang imag and thei ar strang prison like ourselv i repli and thei see onli their own shadow or the shadow of on anoth which the fire throw on the opposit wall of the cave true he said how could thei see anyth but the shadow if thei were never allow to move their head and of the object which ar be carri in like manner thei would onli see the shadow ye he said and if thei were abl to convers with on anoth would thei not suppos that thei were name what wa actual befor them veri true and suppos further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would thei not be sure to fanci when on of the passersbi spoke that the voic which thei heard came from the pass shadow no question he repli to them i said the truth would be liter noth but the shadow of the imag that is certain and now look again and see what will natur follow if the prison ar releas and disabus of their error at first when ani of them is liber and compel suddenli to stand up and turn hi neck round and walk and look toward the light he will suffer sharp pain the glare will distress him and he will be unabl to see the realiti of which in hi former state he had seen the shadow and then conceiv some on sai to him that what he saw befor wa an illus but that now when he is approach nearer to be and hi ey is turn toward more real exist he ha a clearer visionwhat will be hi repli and you mai further imagin that hi instructor is point to the object as thei pass and requir him to name themwil he not be perplex will he not fanci that the shadow which he formerli saw ar truer than the object which ar now shown to him far truer and if he is compel to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in hi ey which will make him turn awai to take refug in the object of vision which he can see and which he will conceiv to be in realiti clearer than the thing which ar now be shown to him true he said and suppos onc more that he is reluctantli drag up a steep and rug ascent and held fast until he is forc into the presenc of the sun himself is he not like to be pain and irrit when he approach the light hi ey will be dazzl and he will not be abl to see anyth at all of what ar now call realiti not all in a moment he said he will requir to grow accustom to the sight of the upper world and first he will see the shadow best next the reflect of men and other object in the water and then the object themselv then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the star and the spangl heaven and he will see the sky and the star by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by dai certainli last of all he will be abl to see the sun and not mere reflect of him in the water but he will see him in hi own proper place and not in anoth and he will contempl him as he is certainli he will then proce to argu that thi is he who give the season and the year and is the guardian of all that is in the visibl world and in a certain wai the caus of all thing which he and hi fellow have been accustom to behold clearli he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him and when he rememb hi old habit and the wisdom of the den and hi fellowprison do you not suppos that he would felicit himself on the chang and piti them certainli he would and if thei were in the habit of confer honour among themselv on those who were quickest to observ the pass shadow and to remark which of them went befor and which follow after and which were togeth and who were therefor best abl to draw conclus as to the futur do you think that he would care for such honour and glori or envi the possessor of them would he not sai with homer better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endur anyth rather than think as thei do and live after their manner ye he said i think that he would rather suffer anyth than entertain these fals notion and live in thi miser manner imagin onc more i said such an on come suddenli out of the sun to be replac in hi old situat would he not be certain to have hi ey full of dark to be sure he said and if there were a contest and he had to compet in measur the shadow with the prison who had never move out of the den while hi sight wa still weak and befor hi ey had becom steadi and the time which would be need to acquir thi new habit of sight might be veri consider would he not be ridicul men would sai of him that up he went and down he came without hi ey and that it wa better not even to think of ascend and if ani on tri to loos anoth and lead him up to the light let them onli catch the offend and thei would put him to death no question he said thi entir allegori i said you mai now append dear glaucon to the previou argument the prisonhous is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journei upward to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectu world accord to my poor belief which at your desir i have expressedwheth rightli or wrongli god know but whether true or fals my opinion is that in the world of knowledg the idea of good appear last of all and is seen onli with an effort and when seen is also infer to be the univers author of all thing beauti and right parent of light and of the lord of light in thi visibl world and the immedi sourc of reason and truth in the intellectu and that thi is the power upon which he who would act ration either in public or privat life must have hi ey fix i agre he said as far as i am abl to understand you moreov i said you must not wonder that those who attain to thi beatif vision ar unwil to descend to human affair for their soul ar ever hasten into the upper world where thei desir to dwell which desir of their is veri natur if our allegori mai be trust ye veri natur and is there anyth surpris in on who pass from divin contempl to the evil state of man misbehav himself in a ridicul manner if while hi ey ar blink and befor he ha becom accustom to the surround dark he is compel to fight in court of law or in other place about the imag or the shadow of imag of justic and is endeavour to meet the concept of those who have never yet seen absolut justic anyth but surpris he repli ani on who ha common sens will rememb that the bewilder of the ey ar of two kind and aris from two caus either from come out of the light or from go into the light which is true of the mind ey quit as much as of the bodili ey and he who rememb thi when he see ani on whose vision is perplex and weak will not be too readi to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man ha come out of the brighter life and is unabl to see becaus unaccustom to the dark or have turn from dark to the dai is dazzl by excess of light and he will count the on happi in hi condit and state of be and he will piti the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which come from below into the light there will be more reason in thi than in the laugh which greet him who return from abov out of the light into the den that he said is a veri just distinct but then if i am right certain professor of educ must be wrong when thei sai that thei can put a knowledg into the soul which wa not there befor like sight into blind ey thei undoubtedli sai thi he repli wherea our argument show that the power and capac of learn exist in the soul alreadi and that just as the ey wa unabl to turn from dark to light without the whole bodi so too the instrument of knowledg can onli by the movement of the whole soul be turn from the world of becom into that of be and learn by degre to endur the sight of be and of the brightest and best of be or in other word of the good veri true and must there not be some art which will effect convers in the easiest and quickest manner not implant the faculti of sight for that exist alreadi but ha been turn in the wrong direct and is look awai from the truth ye he said such an art mai be presum and wherea the other socal virtu of the soul seem to be akin to bodili qualiti for even when thei ar not origin innat thei can be implant later by habit and exercis the virtu of wisdom more than anyth els contain a divin element which alwai remain and by thi convers is render us and profit or on the other hand hurt and useless did you never observ the narrow intellig flash from the keen ey of a clever roguehow eager he is how clearli hi paltri soul see the wai to hi end he is the revers of blind but hi keen eyesight is forc into the servic of evil and he is mischiev in proport to hi clever veri true he said but what if there had been a circumcis of such natur in the dai of their youth and thei had been sever from those sensual pleasur such as eat and drink which like leaden weight were attach to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their soul upon the thing that ar belowif i sai thei had been releas from these impedi and turn in the opposit direct the veri same faculti in them would have seen the truth as keenli as thei see what their ey ar turn to now veri like ye i said and there is anoth thing which is like or rather a necessari infer from what ha preced that neither the uneduc and uninform of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their educ will be abl minist of state not the former becaus thei have no singl aim of duti which is the rule of all their action privat as well as public nor the latter becaus thei will not act at all except upon compuls fanci that thei ar alreadi dwell apart in the island of the blest veri true he repli then i said the busi of us who ar the founder of the state will be to compel the best mind to attain that knowledg which we have alreadi shown to be the greatest of allthei must continu to ascend until thei arriv at the good but when thei have ascend and seen enough we must not allow them to do as thei do now what do you mean i mean that thei remain in the upper world but thi must not be allow thei must be made to descend again among the prison in the den and partak of their labour and honour whether thei ar worth have or not but is not thi unjust he said ought we to give them a wors life when thei might have a better you have again forgotten my friend i said the intent of the legisl who did not aim at make ani on class in the state happi abov the rest the happi wa to be in the whole state and he held the citizen togeth by persuas and necess make them benefactor of the state and therefor benefactor of on anoth to thi end he creat them not to pleas themselv but to be hi instrument in bind up the state true he said i had forgotten observ glaucon that there will be no injustic in compel our philosoph to have a care and provid of other we shall explain to them that in other state men of their class ar not oblig to share in the toil of polit and thi is reason for thei grow up at their own sweet will and the govern would rather not have them be selftaught thei cannot be expect to show ani gratitud for a cultur which thei have never receiv but we have brought you into the world to be ruler of the hive king of yourselv and of the other citizen and have educ you far better and more perfectli than thei have been educ and you ar better abl to share in the doubl duti wherefor each of you when hi turn come must go down to the gener underground abod and get the habit of see in the dark when you have acquir the habit you will see ten thousand time better than the inhabit of the den and you will know what the sever imag ar and what thei repres becaus you have seen the beauti and just and good in their truth and thu our state which is also your will be a realiti and not a dream onli and will be administ in a spirit unlik that of other state in which men fight with on anoth about shadow onli and ar distract in the struggl for power which in their ey is a great good wherea the truth is that the state in which the ruler ar most reluct to govern is alwai the best and most quietli govern and the state in which thei ar most eager the worst quit true he repli and will our pupil when thei hear thi refus to take their turn at the toil of state when thei ar allow to spend the greater part of their time with on anoth in the heavenli light imposs he answer for thei ar just men and the command which we impos upon them ar just there can be no doubt that everi on of them will take offic as a stern necess and not after the fashion of our present ruler of state ye my friend i said and there li the point you must contriv for your futur ruler anoth and a better life than that of a ruler and then you mai have a wellord state for onli in the state which offer thi will thei rule who ar truli rich not in silver and gold but in virtu and wisdom which ar the true bless of life wherea if thei go to the administr of public affair poor and hunger after their own privat advantag think that henc thei ar to snatch the chief good order there can never be for thei will be fight about offic and the civil and domest broil which thu aris will be the ruin of the ruler themselv and of the whole state most true he repli and the onli life which look down upon the life of polit ambit is that of true philosophi do you know of ani other inde i do not he said and those who govern ought not to be lover of the task for if thei ar there will be rival lover and thei will fight no question who then ar those whom we shall compel to be guardian sure thei will be the men who ar wisest about affair of state and by whom the state is best administ and who at the same time have other honour and anoth and a better life than that of polit thei ar the men and i will choos them he repli and now shall we consid in what wai such guardian will be produc and how thei ar to be brought from dark to lighta some ar said to have ascend from the world below to the god by all mean he repli the process i said is not the turn over of an oystershel in allus to a game in which two parti fled or pursu accord as an oystershel which wa thrown into the air fell with the dark or light side uppermost but the turn round of a soul pass from a dai which is littl better than night to the true dai of be that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophi quit so and should we not enquir what sort of knowledg ha the power of effect such a chang certainli what sort of knowledg is there which would draw the soul from becom to be and anoth consider ha just occur to me you will rememb that our young men ar to be warrior athlet ye that wa said then thi new kind of knowledg must have an addit qualiti what qualiti us in war ye if possibl there were two part in our former scheme of educ were there not just so there wa gymnast which presid over the growth and decai of the bodi and mai therefor be regard as have to do with gener and corrupt true then that is not the knowledg which we ar seek to discov no but what do you sai of music which also enter to a certain extent into our former scheme music he said as you will rememb wa the counterpart of gymnast and train the guardian by the influenc of habit by harmoni make them harmoni by rhythm rhythmic but not give them scienc and the word whether fabul or possibl true had kindr element of rhythm and harmoni in them but in music there wa noth which tend to that good which you ar now seek you ar most accur i said in your recollect in music there certainli wa noth of the kind but what branch of knowledg is there my dear glaucon which is of the desir natur sinc all the us art were reckon mean by us undoubtedli and yet if music and gymnast ar exclud and the art ar also exclud what remain well i said there mai be noth left of our special subject and then we shall have to take someth which is not special but of univers applic what mai that be a someth which all art and scienc and intellig us in common and which everi on first ha to learn among the element of educ what is that the littl matter of distinguish on two and threein a word number and calculationdo not all art and scienc necessarili partak of them ye then the art of war partak of them to be sure then palamed whenev he appear in tragedi prove agamemnon ridicul unfit to be a gener did you never remark how he declar that he had invent number and had number the ship and set in arrai the rank of the armi at troi which impli that thei had never been number befor and agamemnon must be suppos liter to have been incap of count hi own feethow could he if he wa ignor of number and if that is true what sort of gener must he have been i should sai a veri strang on if thi wa as you sai can we deni that a warrior should have a knowledg of arithmet certainli he should if he is to have the smallest understand of militari tactic or inde i should rather sai if he is to be a man at all i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of thi studi what is your notion it appear to me to be a studi of the kind which we ar seek and which lead natur to reflect but never to have been rightli us for the true us of it is simpli to draw the soul toward be will you explain your mean he said i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiri with me and sai ye or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branch of knowledg have thi attract power in order that we mai have clearer proof that arithmet is as i suspect on of them explain he said i mean to sai that object of sens ar of two kind some of them do not invit thought becaus the sens is an adequ judg of them while in the case of other object sens is so untrustworthi that further enquiri is imper demand you ar clearli refer he said to the manner in which the sens ar impos upon by distanc and by paint in light and shade no i said that is not at all my mean then what is your mean when speak of uninvit object i mean those which do not pass from on sensat to the opposit invit object ar those which do in thi latter case the sens come upon the object whether at a distanc or near give no more vivid idea of anyth in particular than of it opposit an illustr will make my mean clearerher ar three fingersa littl finger a second finger and a middl finger veri good you mai suppos that thei ar seen quit close and here come the point what is it each of them equal appear a finger whether seen in the middl or at the extrem whether white or black or thick or thinit make no differ a finger is a finger all the same in these case a man is not compel to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the sight never intim to the mind that a finger is other than a finger true and therefor i said as we might expect there is noth here which invit or excit intellig there is not he said but is thi equal true of the great and small of the finger can sight adequ perceiv them and is no differ made by the circumst that on of the finger is in the middl and anoth at the extrem and in like manner doe the touch adequ perceiv the qualiti of thick or thin of soft or hard and so of the other sens do thei give perfect intim of such matter is not their mode of oper on thi wiseth sens which is concern with the qualiti of hard is necessarili concern also with the qualiti of soft and onli intim to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft you ar quit right he said and must not the soul be perplex at thi intim which the sens give of a hard which is also soft what again is the mean of light and heavi if that which is light is also heavi and that which is heavi light ye he said these intim which the soul receiv ar veri curiou and requir to be explain ye i said and in these perplex the soul natur summon to her aid calcul and intellig that she mai see whether the sever object announc to her ar on or two true and if thei turn out to be two is not each of them on and differ certainli and if each is on and both ar two she will conceiv the two as in a state of divis for if there were undivid thei could onli be conceiv of as on true the ey certainli did see both small and great but onli in a confus manner thei were not distinguish ye wherea the think mind intend to light up the chao wa compel to revers the process and look at small and great as separ and not confus veri true wa not thi the begin of the enquiri what is great and what is small exactli so and thu aros the distinct of the visibl and the intellig most true thi wa what i meant when i spoke of impress which invit the intellect or the reversethos which ar simultan with opposit impress invit thought those which ar not simultan do not i understand he said and agre with you and to which class do uniti and number belong i do not know he repli think a littl and you will see that what ha preced will suppli the answer for if simpl uniti could be adequ perceiv by the sight or by ani other sens then as we were sai in the case of the finger there would be noth to attract toward be but when there is some contradict alwai present and on is the revers of on and involv the concept of plural then thought begin to be arous within us and the soul perplex and want to arriv at a decis ask what is absolut uniti thi is the wai in which the studi of the on ha a power of draw and convert the mind to the contempl of true be and sure he said thi occur notabl in the case of on for we see the same thing to be both on and infinit in multitud ye i said and thi be true of on must be equal true of all number certainli and all arithmet and calcul have to do with number ye and thei appear to lead the mind toward truth ye in a veri remark manner then thi is knowledg of the kind for which we ar seek have a doubl us militari and philosoph for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to arrai hi troop and the philosoph also becaus he ha to rise out of the sea of chang and lai hold of true be and therefor he must be an arithmetician that is true and our guardian is both warrior and philosoph certainli then thi is a kind of knowledg which legisl mai fitli prescrib and we must endeavour to persuad those who ar to be the princip men of our state to go and learn arithmet not as amateur but thei must carri on the studi until thei see the natur of number with the mind onli nor again like merchant or retailtrad with a view to bui or sell but for the sake of their militari us and of the soul herself and becaus thi will be the easiest wai for her to pass from becom to truth and be that is excel he said ye i said and now have spoken of it i must add how charm the scienc is and in how mani wai it conduc to our desir end if pursu in the spirit of a philosoph and not of a shopkeep how do you mean i mean as i wa sai that arithmet ha a veri great and elev effect compel the soul to reason about abstract number and rebel against the introduct of visibl or tangibl object into the argument you know how steadili the master of the art repel and ridicul ani on who attempt to divid absolut uniti when he is calcul and if you divid thei multipli mean either that thei integr the number becaus thei deni the possibl of fraction or that divis is regard by them as a process of multipl for the fraction of on continu to be unit take care that on shall continu on and not becom lost in fraction that is veri true now suppos a person were to sai to them o my friend what ar these wonder number about which you ar reason in which as you sai there is a uniti such as you demand and each unit is equal invari indivisiblewhat would thei answer thei would answer as i should conceiv that thei were speak of those number which can onli be realiz in thought then you see that thi knowledg mai be truli call necessari necessit as it clearli doe the us of the pure intellig in the attain of pure truth ye that is a mark characterist of it and have you further observ that those who have a natur talent for calcul ar gener quick at everi other kind of knowledg and even the dull if thei have had an arithmet train although thei mai deriv no other advantag from it alwai becom much quicker than thei would otherwis have been veri true he said and inde you will not easili find a more difficult studi and not mani as difficult you will not and for all these reason arithmet is a kind of knowledg in which the best natur should be train and which must not be given up i agre let thi then be made on of our subject of educ and next shall we enquir whether the kindr scienc also concern us you mean geometri exactli so clearli he said we ar concern with that part of geometri which relat to war for in pitch a camp or take up a posit or close or extend the line of an armi or ani other militari manoeuvr whether in actual battl or on a march it will make all the differ whether a gener is or is not a geometrician ye i said but for that purpos a veri littl of either geometri or calcul will be enough the question relat rather to the greater and more advanc part of geometrywheth that tend in ani degre to make more easi the vision of the idea of good and thither as i wa sai all thing tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze toward that place where is the full perfect of be which she ought by all mean to behold true he said then if geometri compel us to view be it concern us if becom onli it doe not concern us ye that is what we assert yet anybodi who ha the least acquaint with geometri will not deni that such a concept of the scienc is in flat contradict to the ordinari languag of geometrician how so thei have in view practic onli and ar alwai speak in a narrow and ridicul manner of squar and extend and appli and the likethei confus the necess of geometri with those of daili life wherea knowledg is the real object of the whole scienc certainli he said then must not a further admiss be made what admiss that the knowledg at which geometri aim is knowledg of the etern and not of aught perish and transient that he repli mai be readili allow and is true then my nobl friend geometri will draw the soul toward truth and creat the spirit of philosophi and rais up that which is now unhappili allow to fall down noth will be more like to have such an effect then noth should be more sternli laid down than that the inhabit of your fair citi should by all mean learn geometri moreov the scienc ha indirect effect which ar not small of what kind he said there ar the militari advantag of which you spoke i said and in all depart of knowledg as experi prove ani on who ha studi geometri is infinit quicker of apprehens than on who ha not ye inde he said there is an infinit differ between them then shall we propos thi as a second branch of knowledg which our youth will studi let us do so he repli and suppos we make astronomi the thirdwhat do you sai i am strongli inclin to it he said the observ of the season and of month and year is as essenti to the gener as it is to the farmer or sailor i am amus i said at your fear of the world which make you guard against the appear of insist upon useless studi and i quit admit the difficulti of believ that in everi man there is an ey of the soul which when by other pursuit lost and dim is by these purifi and reillumin and is more preciou far than ten thousand bodili ey for by it alon is truth seen now there ar two class of person on class of those who will agre with you and will take your word as a revel anoth class to whom thei will be utterli unmean and who will natur deem them to be idl tale for thei see no sort of profit which is to be obtain from them and therefor you had better decid at onc with which of the two you ar propos to argu you will veri like sai with neither and that your chief aim in carri on the argument is your own improv at the same time you do not grudg to other ani benefit which thei mai receiv i think that i should prefer to carri on the argument mainli on my own behalf then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the scienc what wa the mistak he said after plane geometri i said we proceed at onc to solid in revolut instead of take solid in themselv wherea after the second dimens the third which is concern with cube and dimens of depth ought to have follow that is true socrat but so littl seem to be known as yet about these subject why ye i said and for two reasonsin the first place no govern patronis them thi lead to a want of energi in the pursuit of them and thei ar difficult in the second place student cannot learn them unless thei have a director but then a director can hardli be found and even if he could as matter now stand the student who ar veri conceit would not attend to him that howev would be otherwis if the whole state becam the director of these studi and gave honour to them then discipl would want to come and there would be continu and earnest search and discoveri would be made sinc even now disregard as thei ar by the world and maim of their fair proport and although none of their votari can tell the us of them still these studi forc their wai by their natur charm and veri like if thei had the help of the state thei would some dai emerg into light ye he said there is a remark charm in them but i do not clearli understand the chang in the order first you began with a geometri of plane surfac ye i said and you place astronomi next and then you made a step backward ye and i have delai you by my hurri the ludicr state of solid geometri which in natur order should have follow made me pass over thi branch and go on to astronomi or motion of solid true he said then assum that the scienc now omit would come into exist if encourag by the state let us go on to astronomi which will be fourth the right order he repli and now socrat as you rebuk the vulgar manner in which i prais astronomi befor my prais shall be given in your own spirit for everi on as i think must see that astronomi compel the soul to look upward and lead us from thi world to anoth everi on but myself i said to everi on els thi mai be clear but not to me and what then would you sai i should rather sai that those who elev astronomi into philosophi appear to me to make us look downward and not upward what do you mean he ask you i repli have in your mind a truli sublim concept of our knowledg of the thing abov and i dare sai that if a person were to throw hi head back and studi the fret ceil you would still think that hi mind wa the percipi and not hi ey and you ar veri like right and i mai be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledg onli which is of be and of the unseen can make the soul look upward and whether a man gape at the heaven or blink on the ground seek to learn some particular of sens i would deni that he can learn for noth of that sort is matter of scienc hi soul is look downward not upward whether hi wai to knowledg is by water or by land whether he float or onli li on hi back i acknowledg he said the justic of your rebuk still i should like to ascertain how astronomi can be learn in ani manner more conduc to that knowledg of which we ar speak i will tell you i said the starri heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visibl ground and therefor although the fairest and most perfect of visibl thing must necessarili be deem inferior far to the true motion of absolut swift and absolut slow which ar rel to each other and carri with them that which is contain in them in the true number and in everi true figur now these ar to be apprehend by reason and intellig but not by sight true he repli the spangl heaven should be us as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledg their beauti is like the beauti of figur or pictur excel wrought by the hand of daedalu or some other great artist which we mai chanc to behold ani geometrician who saw them would appreci the exquisit of their workmanship but he would never dream of think that in them he could find the true equal or the true doubl or the truth of ani other proport no he repli such an idea would be ridicul and will not a true astronom have the same feel when he look at the movement of the star will he not think that heaven and the thing in heaven ar frame by the creator of them in the most perfect manner but he will never imagin that the proport of night and dai or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the star to these and to on anoth and ani other thing that ar materi and visibl can also be etern and subject to no deviationthat would be absurd and it is equal absurd to take so much pain in investig their exact truth i quit agre though i never thought of thi befor then i said in astronomi as in geometri we should emploi problem and let the heaven alon if we would approach the subject in the right wai and so make the natur gift of reason to be of ani real us that he said is a work infinit beyond our present astronom ye i said and there ar mani other thing which must also have a similar extens given to them if our legisl is to be of ani valu but can you tell me of ani other suitabl studi no he said not without think motion i said ha mani form and not on onli two of them ar obviou enough even to wit no better than our and there ar other as i imagin which mai be left to wiser person but where ar the two there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the on alreadi name and what mai that be the second i said would seem rel to the ear to be what the first is to the ey for i conceiv that as the ey ar design to look up at the star so ar the ear to hear harmoni motion and these ar sister sciencesa the pythagorean sai and we glaucon agre with them ye he repli but thi i said is a labori studi and therefor we had better go and learn of them and thei will tell us whether there ar ani other applic of these scienc at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object what is that there is a perfect which all knowledg ought to reach and which our pupil ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i wa sai that thei did in astronomi for in the scienc of harmoni as you probabl know the same thing happen the teacher of harmoni compar the sound and conson which ar heard onli and their labour like that of the astronom is in vain ye by heaven he said and ti as good as a plai to hear them talk about their condens note as thei call them thei put their ear close alongsid of the string like person catch a sound from their neighbour wallon set of them declar that thei distinguish an intermedi note and have found the least interv which should be the unit of measur the other insist that the two sound have pass into the sameeith parti set their ear befor their understand you mean i said those gentlemen who teas and tortur the string and rack them on the peg of the instrument i might carri on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blow which the plectrum give and make accus against the string both of backward and forward to sound but thi would be tediou and therefor i will onli sai that these ar not the men and that i am refer to the pythagorean of whom i wa just now propos to enquir about harmoni for thei too ar in error like the astronom thei investig the number of the harmoni which ar heard but thei never attain to problemsthat is to sai thei never reach the natur harmoni of number or reflect why some number ar harmoni and other not that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledg a thing i repli which i would rather call us that is if sought after with a view to the beauti and good but if pursu in ani other spirit useless veri true he said now when all these studi reach the point of intercommunion and connect with on anoth and come to be consid in their mutual affin then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a valu for our object otherwis there is no profit in them i suspect so but you ar speak socrat of a vast work what do you mean i said the prelud or what do you not know that all thi is but the prelud to the actual strain which we have to learn for you sure would not regard the skill mathematician as a dialectician assuredli not he said i have hardli ever known a mathematician who wa capabl of reason but do you imagin that men who ar unabl to give and take a reason will have the knowledg which we requir of them neither can thi be suppos and so glaucon i said we have at last arriv at the hymn of dialect thi is that strain which is of the intellect onli but which the faculti of sight will nevertheless be found to imit for sight as you mai rememb wa imagin by us after a while to behold the real anim and star and last of all the sun himself and so with dialect when a person start on the discoveri of the absolut by the light of reason onli and without ani assist of sens and persever until by pure intellig he arriv at the percept of the absolut good he at last find himself at the end of the intellectu world as in the case of sight at the end of the visibl exactli he said then thi is the progress which you call dialect true but the releas of the prison from chain and their translat from the shadow to the imag and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in hi presenc thei ar vainli try to look on anim and plant and the light of the sun but ar abl to perceiv even with their weak ey the imag in the water which ar divin and ar the shadow of true exist not shadow of imag cast by a light of fire which compar with the sun is onli an imagethi power of elev the highest principl in the soul to the contempl of that which is best in exist with which we mai compar the rais of that faculti which is the veri light of the bodi to the sight of that which is brightest in the materi and visibl worldthi power is given as i wa sai by all that studi and pursuit of the art which ha been describ i agre in what you ar sai he repli which mai be hard to believ yet from anoth point of view is harder still to deni thi howev is not a theme to be treat of in pass onli but will have to be discuss again and again and so whether our conclus be true or fals let us assum all thi and proce at onc from the prelud or preambl to the chief strain a plai upon the greek word which mean both law and strain and describ that in like manner sai then what is the natur and what ar the divis of dialect and what ar the path which lead thither for these path will also lead to our final rest dear glaucon i said you will not be abl to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an imag onli but the absolut truth accord to my notion whether what i told you would or would not have been a realiti i cannot ventur to sai but you would have seen someth like realiti of that i am confid doubtless he repli but i must also remind you that the power of dialect alon can reveal thi and onli to on who is a discipl of the previou scienc of that assert you mai be as confid as of the last and assuredli no on will argu that there is ani other method of comprehend by ani regular process all true exist or of ascertain what each thing is in it own natur for the art in gener ar concern with the desir or opinion of men or ar cultiv with a view to product and construct or for the preserv of such product and construct and as to the mathemat scienc which as we were sai have some apprehens of true beinggeometri and the likethei onli dream about be but never can thei behold the wake realiti so long as thei leav the hypothes which thei us unexamin and ar unabl to give an account of them for when a man know not hi own first principl and when the conclus and intermedi step ar also construct out of he know not what how can he imagin that such a fabric of convent can ever becom scienc imposs he said then dialect and dialect alon goe directli to the first principl and is the onli scienc which doe awai with hypothes in order to make her ground secur the ey of the soul which is liter buri in an outlandish slough is by her gentl aid lift upward and she us as handmaid and helper in the work of convers the scienc which we have been discuss custom term them scienc but thei ought to have some other name impli greater clear than opinion and less clear than scienc and thi in our previou sketch wa call understand but why should we disput about name when we have realiti of such import to consid why inde he said when ani name will do which express the thought of the mind with clear at ani rate we ar satisfi as befor to have four divis two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first divis scienc the second understand the third belief and the fourth percept of shadow opinion be concern with becom and intellect with be and so to make a proport as be is to becom so is pure intellect to opinion and as intellect is to opinion so is scienc to belief and understand to the percept of shadow but let us defer the further correl and subdivis of the subject of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiri mani time longer than thi ha been as far as i understand he said i agre and do you also agre i said in describ the dialectician as on who attain a concept of the essenc of each thing and he who doe not possess and is therefor unabl to impart thi concept in whatev degre he fail mai in that degre also be said to fail in intellig will you admit so much ye he said how can i deni it and you would sai the same of the concept of the good until the person is abl to abstract and defin ration the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all object and is readi to disprov them not by appeal to opinion but to absolut truth never falter at ani step of the argumentunless he can do all thi you would sai that he know neither the idea of good nor ani other good he apprehend onli a shadow if anyth at all which is given by opinion and not by sciencedream and slumber in thi life befor he is well awak here he arriv at the world below and ha hi final quietu in all that i should most certainli agre with you and sure you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you ar nurtur and educatingif the ideal ever becom a realityy would not allow the futur ruler to be like post liter line probabl the startingpoint of a racecours have no reason in them and yet to be set in author over the highest matter certainli not then you will make a law that thei shall have such an educ as will enabl them to attain the greatest skill in ask and answer question ye he said you and i togeth will make it dialect then as you will agre is the copingston of the scienc and is set over them no other scienc can be place higherth natur of knowledg can no further go i agre he said but to whom we ar to assign these studi and in what wai thei ar to be assign ar question which remain to be consid ye clearli you rememb i said how the ruler were chosen befor certainli he said the same natur must still be chosen and the prefer again given to the surest and the bravest and if possibl to the fairest and have nobl and gener temper thei should also have the natur gift which will facilit their educ and what ar these such gift as keen and readi power of acquisit for the mind more often faint from the sever of studi than from the sever of gymnast the toil is more entir the mind own and is not share with the bodi veri true he repli further he of whom we ar in search should have a good memori and be an unweari solid man who is a lover of labour in ani line or he will never be abl to endur the great amount of bodili exercis and to go through all the intellectu disciplin and studi which we requir of him certainli he said he must have natur gift the mistak at present is that those who studi philosophi have no vocat and thi as i wa befor sai is the reason why she ha fallen into disreput her true son should take her by the hand and not bastard what do you mean in the first place her votari should not have a lame or halt industryi mean that he should not be half industri and half idl as for exampl when a man is a lover of gymnast and hunt and all other bodili exercis but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learn or listen or enquir or the occup to which he devot himself mai be of an opposit kind and he mai have the other sort of lame certainli he said and as to truth i said is not a soul equal to be deem halt and lame which hate voluntari falsehood and is extrem indign at herself and other when thei tell li but is patient of involuntari falsehood and doe not mind wallow like a swinish beast in the mire of ignor and ha no shame at be detect to be sure and again in respect of temper courag magnific and everi other virtu should we not carefulli distinguish between the true son and the bastard for where there is no discern of such qualiti state and individu unconsci err and the state make a ruler and the individu a friend of on who be defect in some part of virtu is in a figur lame or a bastard that is veri true he said all these thing then will have to be carefulli consid by us and if onli those whom we introduc to thi vast system of educ and train ar sound in bodi and mind justic herself will have noth to sai against us and we shall be the saviour of the constitut and of the state but if our pupil ar men of anoth stamp the revers will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicul on philosophi than she ha to endur at present that would not be credit certainli not i said and yet perhap in thu turn jest into earnest i am equal ridicul in what respect i had forgotten i said that we were not seriou and spoke with too much excit for when i saw philosophi so undeservedli trampl under foot of men i could not help feel a sort of indign at the author of her disgrac and my anger made me too vehement inde i wa listen and did not think so but i who am the speaker felt that i wa and now let me remind you that although in our former select we chose old men we must not do so in thi solon wa under a delus when he said that a man when he grow old mai learn mani thingsfor he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for ani extraordinari toil of cours and therefor calcul and geometri and all the other element of instruct which ar a prepar for dialect should be present to the mind in childhood not howev under ani notion of forc our system of educ why not becaus a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisit of knowledg of ani kind bodili exercis when compulsori doe no harm to the bodi but knowledg which is acquir under compuls obtain no hold on the mind veri true then my good friend i said do not us compuls but let earli educ be a sort of amus you will then be better abl to find out the natur bent that is a veri ration notion he said do you rememb that the children too were to be taken to see the battl on horseback and that if there were no danger thei were to be brought close up and like young hound have a tast of blood given them ye i rememb the same practic mai be follow i said in all these thingslabour lesson dangersand he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrol in a select number at what ag at the ag when the necessari gymnast ar over the period whether of two or three year which pass in thi sort of train is useless for ani other purpos for sleep and exercis ar unpropiti to learn and the trial of who is first in gymnast exercis is on of the most import test to which our youth ar subject certainli he repli after that time those who ar select from the class of twenti year old will be promot to higher honour and the scienc which thei learn without ani order in their earli educ will now be brought togeth and thei will be abl to see the natur relationship of them to on anoth and to true be ye he said that is the onli kind of knowledg which take last root ye i said and the capac for such knowledg is the great criterion of dialect talent the comprehens mind is alwai the dialect i agre with you he said these i said ar the point which you must consid and those who have most of thi comprehens and who ar most steadfast in their learn and in their militari and other appoint duti when thei have arriv at the ag of thirti have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elev to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialect in order to learn which of them is abl to give up the us of sight and the other sens and in compani with truth to attain absolut be and here my friend great caution is requir why great caution do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialect ha introduc what evil he said the student of the art ar fill with lawless quit true he said do you think that there is anyth so veri unnatur or inexcus in their case or will you make allow for them in what wai make allow i want you i said by wai of parallel to imagin a supposititi son who is brought up in great wealth he is on of a great and numer famili and ha mani flatter when he grow up to manhood he learn that hi alleg ar not hi real parent but who the real ar he is unabl to discov can you guess how he will be like to behav toward hi flatter and hi suppos parent first of all dure the period when he is ignor of the fals relat and then again when he know or shall i guess for you if you pleas then i should sai that while he is ignor of the truth he will be like to honour hi father and hi mother and hi suppos relat more than the flatter he will be less inclin to neglect them when in need or to do or sai anyth against them and he will be less will to disobei them in ani import matter he will but when he ha made the discoveri i should imagin that he would diminish hi honour and regard for them and would becom more devot to the flatter their influenc over him would greatli increas he would now live after their wai and openli associ with them and unless he were of an unusu good disposit he would troubl himself no more about hi suppos parent or other relat well all that is veri probabl but how is the imag applic to the discipl of philosophi in thi wai you know that there ar certain principl about justic and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parent author we have been brought up obei and honour them that is true there ar also opposit maxim and habit of pleasur which flatter and attract the soul but do not influenc those of us who have ani sens of right and thei continu to obei and honour the maxim of their father true now when a man is in thi state and the question spirit ask what is fair or honour and he answer as the legisl ha taught him and then argument mani and divers refut hi word until he is driven into believ that noth is honour ani more than dishonour or just and good ani more than the revers and so of all the notion which he most valu do you think that he will still honour and obei them as befor imposs and when he ceas to think them honour and natur as heretofor and he fail to discov the true can he be expect to pursu ani life other than that which flatter hi desir he cannot and from be a keeper of the law he is convert into a breaker of it unquestion now all thi is veri natur in student of philosophi such as i have describ and also as i wa just now sai most excus ye he said and i mai add pitiabl therefor that your feel mai not be move to piti about our citizen who ar now thirti year of ag everi care must be taken in introduc them to dialect certainli there is a danger lest thei should tast the dear delight too earli for youngster as you mai have observ when thei first get the tast in their mouth argu for amus and ar alwai contradict and refut other in imit of those who refut them like puppydog thei rejoic in pull and tear at all who come near them ye he said there is noth which thei like better and when thei have made mani conquest and receiv defeat at the hand of mani thei violent and speedili get into a wai of not believ anyth which thei believ befor and henc not onli thei but philosophi and all that relat to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world too true he said but when a man begin to get older he will no longer be guilti of such insan he will imit the dialectician who is seek for truth and not the erist who is contradict for the sake of amus and the greater moder of hi charact will increas instead of diminish the honour of the pursuit veri true he said and did we not make special provis for thi when we said that the discipl of philosophi were to be orderli and steadfast not as now ani chanc aspir or intrud veri true suppos i said the studi of philosophi to take the place of gymnast and to be continu dilig and earnestli and exclus for twice the number of year which were pass in bodili exercisewil that be enough would you sai six or four year he ask sai five year i repli at the end of the time thei must be sent down again into the den and compel to hold ani militari or other offic which young men ar qualifi to hold in thi wai thei will get their experi of life and there will be an opportun of try whether when thei ar drawn all manner of wai by temptat thei will stand firm or flinch and how long is thi stage of their live to last fifteen year i answer and when thei have reach fifti year of ag then let those who still surviv and have distinguish themselv in everi action of their live and in everi branch of knowledg come at last to their consumm the time ha now arriv at which thei must rais the ey of the soul to the univers light which lighten all thing and behold the absolut good for that is the pattern accord to which thei ar to order the state and the live of individu and the remaind of their own live also make philosophi their chief pursuit but when their turn come toil also at polit and rule for the public good not as though thei were perform some heroic action but simpli as a matter of duti and when thei have brought up in each gener other like themselv and left them in their place to be governor of the state then thei will depart to the island of the blest and dwell there and the citi will give them public memori and sacrific and honour them if the pythian oracl consent as demigod but if not as in ani case bless and divin you ar a sculptor socrat and have made statu of our governor faultless in beauti ye i said glaucon and of our gover too for you must not suppos that what i have been sai appli to men onli and not to women as far as their natur can go there you ar right he said sinc we have made them to share in all thing like the men well i said and you would agre would you not that what ha been said about the state and the govern is not a mere dream and although difficult not imposs but onli possibl in the wai which ha been suppos that is to sai when the true philosoph king ar born in a state on or more of them despis the honour of thi present world which thei deem mean and worthless esteem abov all thing right and the honour that spring from right and regard justic as the greatest and most necessari of all thing whose minist thei ar and whose principl will be exalt by them when thei set in order their own citi how will thei proce thei will begin by send out into the countri all the inhabit of the citi who ar more than ten year old and will take possess of their children who will be unaffect by the habit of their parent these thei will train in their own habit and law i mean in the law which we have given them and in thi wai the state and constitut of which we were speak will soonest and most easili attain happi and the nation which ha such a constitut will gain most ye that will be the best wai and i think socrat that you have veri well describ how if ever such a constitut might come into be enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bear it imagether is no difficulti in see how we shall describ him there is no difficulti he repli and i agre with you in think that noth more need be said book viii and so glaucon we have arriv at the conclus that in the perfect state wive and children ar to be in common and that all educ and the pursuit of war and peac ar also to be common and the best philosoph and the bravest warrior ar to be their king that repli glaucon ha been acknowledg ye i said and we have further acknowledg that the governor when appoint themselv will take their soldier and place them in hous such as we were describ which ar common to all and contain noth privat or individu and about their properti you rememb what we agre ye i rememb that no on wa to have ani of the ordinari possess of mankind thei were to be warrior athlet and guardian receiv from the other citizen in lieu of annual payment onli their mainten and thei were to take care of themselv and of the whole state true i said and now that thi divis of our task is conclud let us find the point at which we digress that we mai return into the old path there is no difficulti in return you impli then as now that you had finish the descript of the state you said that such a state wa good and that the man wa good who answer to it although as now appear you had more excel thing to relat both of state and man and you said further that if thi wa the true form then the other were fals and of the fals form you said as i rememb that there were four princip on and that their defect and the defect of the individu correspond to them were worth examin when we had seen all the individu and final agre as to who wa the best and who wa the worst of them we were to consid whether the best wa not also the happiest and the worst the most miser i ask you what were the four form of govern of which you spoke and then polemarchu and adeimantu put in their word and you began again and have found your wai to the point at which we have now arriv your recollect i said is most exact then like a wrestler he repli you must put yourself again in the same posit and let me ask the same question and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then ye if i can i will i said i shall particularli wish to hear what were the four constitut of which you were speak that question i said is easili answer the four govern of which i spoke so far as thei have distinct name ar first those of crete and sparta which ar gener applaud what is term oligarchi come next thi is not equal approv and is a form of govern which teem with evil thirdli democraci which natur follow oligarchi although veri differ and lastli come tyranni great and famou which differ from them all and is the fourth and worst disord of a state i do not know do you of ani other constitut which can be said to have a distinct charact there ar lordship and princip which ar bought and sold and some other intermedi form of govern but these ar nondescript and mai be found equal among hellen and among barbarian ye he repli we certainli hear of mani curiou form of govern which exist among them do you know i said that govern vari as the disposit of men vari and that there must be as mani of the on as there ar of the other for we cannot suppos that state ar made of oak and rock and not out of the human natur which ar in them and which in a figur turn the scale and draw other thing after them ye he said the state ar as the men ar thei grow out of human charact then if the constitut of state ar five the disposit of individu mind will also be five certainli him who answer to aristocraci and whom we rightli call just and good we have alreadi describ we have then let us now proce to describ the inferior sort of natur be the contenti and ambiti who answer to the spartan politi also the oligarch democrat and tyrann let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be abl to compar the rel happi or unhappi of him who lead a life of pure justic or pure injustic the enquiri will then be complet and we shall know whether we ought to pursu injustic as thrasymachu advis or in accord with the conclus of the argument to prefer justic certainli he repli we must do as you sai shall we follow our old plan which we adopt with a view to clear of take the state first and then proceed to the individu and begin with the govern of honouri know of no name for such a govern other than timocraci or perhap timarchi we will compar with thi the like charact in the individu and after that consid oligarchi and the oligarch man and then again we will turn our attent to democraci and the democrat man and lastli we will go and view the citi of tyranni and onc more take a look into the tyrant soul and try to arriv at a satisfactori decis that wai of view and judg of the matter will be veri suitabl first then i said let us enquir how timocraci the govern of honour aris out of aristocraci the govern of the best clearli all polit chang origin in divis of the actual govern power a govern which is unit howev small cannot be move veri true he said in what wai then will our citi be move and in what manner will the two class of auxiliari and ruler disagre among themselv or with on anoth shall we after the manner of homer prai the muse to tell us how discord first aros shall we imagin them in solemn mockeri to plai and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofti tragic vein make believ to be in earnest how would thei address us after thi mannera citi which is thu constitut can hardli be shaken but see that everyth which ha a begin ha also an end even a constitut such as your will not last for ever but will in time be dissolv and thi is the dissolutionin plant that grow in the earth as well as in anim that move on the earth surfac fertil and steril of soul and bodi occur when the circumfer of the circl of each ar complet which in shortliv exist pass over a short space and in longliv on over a long space but to the knowledg of human fecund and steril all the wisdom and educ of your ruler will not attain the law which regul them will not be discov by an intellig which is alloi with sens but will escap them and thei will bring children into the world when thei ought not now that which is of divin birth ha a period which is contain in a perfect number ie a cyclic number such as which is equal to the sum of it divisor so that when the circl or time repres by is complet the lesser time or rotat repres by ar also complet but the period of human birth is comprehend in a number in which first increment by involut and evolut or squar and cube obtain three interv and four term of like and unlik wax and wane number make all the term commensur and agreeabl to on anoth probabl the number of which the three first the side of the pythagorean triangl the term will then be cube cube cube which togeth cube the base of these with a third ad when combin with five and rais to the third power furnish two harmoni the first a squar which is a hundr time as great x or the first a squar which is x the whole number will then be a squar of and an oblong of by and the other a figur have on side equal to the former but oblong consist of a hundr number squar upon ration diamet of a squar ie omit fraction the side of which is five x x each of them be less by on than the perfect squar which includ the fraction sc or less by or consist of two number squar upon irrat diamet etc for other explan of the passag see introduct two perfect squar of irrat diamet of a squar the side of which is five and a hundr cube of three x now thi number repres a geometr figur which ha control over the good and evil of birth for when your guardian ar ignor of the law of birth and unit bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodli or fortun and though onli the best of them will be appoint by their predecessor still thei will be unworthi to hold their father place and when thei come into power as guardian thei will soon be found to fail in take care of us the muse first by undervalu music which neglect will soon extend to gymnast and henc the young men of your state will be less cultiv in the succeed gener ruler will be appoint who have lost the guardian power of test the metal of your differ race which like hesiod ar of gold and silver and brass and iron and so iron will be mingl with silver and brass with gold and henc there will aris dissimilar and inequ and irregular which alwai and in all place ar caus of hatr and war thi the muse affirm to be the stock from which discord ha sprung wherev aris and thi is their answer to us ye and we mai assum that thei answer truli why ye i said of cours thei answer truli how can the muse speak fals and what do the muse sai next when discord aros then the two race were drawn differ wai the iron and brass fell to acquir monei and land and hous and gold and silver but the gold and silver race not want monei but have the true rich in their own natur inclin toward virtu and the ancient order of thing there wa a battl between them and at last thei agre to distribut their land and hous among individu owner and thei enslav their friend and maintain whom thei had formerli protect in the condit of freemen and made of them subject and servant and thei themselv were engag in war and in keep a watch against them i believ that you have rightli conceiv the origin of the chang and the new govern which thu aris will be of a form intermedi between oligarchi and aristocraci veri true such will be the chang and after the chang ha been made how will thei proce clearli the new state be in a mean between oligarchi and the perfect state will partli follow on and partli the other and will also have some peculiar true he said in the honour given to ruler in the abstin of the warrior class from agricultur handicraft and trade in gener in the institut of common meal and in the attent paid to gymnast and militari trainingin all these respect thi state will resembl the former true but in the fear of admit philosoph to power becaus thei ar no longer to be had simpl and earnest but ar made up of mix element and in turn from them to passion and less complex charact who ar by natur fit for war rather than peac and in the valu set by them upon militari stratagem and contriv and in the wage of everlast warsthi state will be for the most part peculiar ye ye i said and men of thi stamp will be covet of monei like those who live in oligarchi thei will have a fierc secret long after gold and silver which thei will hoard in dark place have magazin and treasuri of their own for the deposit and conceal of them also castl which ar just nest for their egg and in which thei will spend larg sum on their wive or on ani other whom thei pleas that is most true he said and thei ar miserli becaus thei have no mean of openli acquir the monei which thei prize thei will spend that which is anoth man on the gratif of their desir steal their pleasur and run awai like children from the law their father thei have been school not by gentl influenc but by forc for thei have neglect her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophi and have honour gymnast more than music undoubtedli he said the form of govern which you describ is a mixtur of good and evil why there is a mixtur i said but on thing and on thing onli is predominantli seenth spirit of content and ambit and these ar due to the preval of the passion or spirit element assuredli he said such is the origin and such the charact of thi state which ha been describ in outlin onli the more perfect execut wa not requir for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectli just and most perfectli unjust and to go through all the state and all the charact of men omit none of them would be an intermin labour veri true he repli now what man answer to thi form of governmenthow did he come into be and what is he like i think said adeimantu that in the spirit of content which characteris him he is not unlik our friend glaucon perhap i said he mai be like him in that on point but there ar other respect in which he is veri differ in what respect he should have more of selfassert and be less cultiv and yet a friend of cultur and he should be a good listen but no speaker such a person is apt to be rough with slave unlik the educ man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteou to freemen and remark obedi to author he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claim to be a ruler not becaus he is eloqu or on ani ground of that sort but becaus he is a soldier and ha perform feat of arm he is also a lover of gymnast exercis and of the chase ye that is the type of charact which answer to timocraci such an on will despis rich onli when he is young but as he get older he will be more and more attract to them becaus he ha a piec of the avarici natur in him and is not singlemind toward virtu have lost hi best guardian who wa that said adeimantu philosophi i said temper with music who come and take up her abod in a man and is the onli saviour of hi virtu throughout life good he said such i said is the timocrat youth and he is like the timocrat state exactli hi origin is as followsh is often the young son of a brave father who dwell in an illgovern citi of which he declin the honour and offic and will not go to law or exert himself in ani wai but is readi to waiv hi right in order that he mai escap troubl and how doe the son come into be the charact of the son begin to develop when he hear hi mother complain that her husband ha no place in the govern of which the consequ is that she ha no preced among other women further when she see her husband not veri eager about monei and instead of battl and rail in the law court or assembl take whatev happen to him quietli and when she observ that hi thought alwai centr in himself while he treat her with veri consider indiffer she is annoi and sai to her son that hi father is onli half a man and far too easygo ad all the other complaint about her own illtreat which women ar so fond of rehears ye said adeimantu thei give us plenti of them and their complaint ar so like themselv and you know i said that the old servant also who ar suppos to be attach to the famili from time to time talk privat in the same strain to the son and if thei see ani on who ow monei to hi father or is wrong him in ani wai and he fail to prosecut them thei tell the youth that when he grow up he must retali upon peopl of thi sort and be more of a man than hi father he ha onli to walk abroad and he hear and see the same sort of thing those who do their own busi in the citi ar call simpleton and held in no esteem while the busybodi ar honour and applaud the result is that the young man hear and see all these thingshear too the word of hi father and have a nearer view of hi wai of life and make comparison of him and othersi drawn opposit wai while hi father is water and nourish the ration principl in hi soul the other ar encourag the passion and appetit and he be not origin of a bad natur but have kept bad compani is at last brought by their joint influenc to a middl point and give up the kingdom which is within him to the middl principl of contenti and passion and becom arrog and ambiti you seem to me to have describ hi origin perfectli then we have now i said the second form of govern and the second type of charact we have next let us look at anoth man who as aeschylu sai is set over against anoth state or rather as our plan requir begin with the state by all mean i believ that oligarchi follow next in order and what manner of govern do you term oligarchi a govern rest on a valuat of properti in which the rich have power and the poor man is depriv of it i understand he repli ought i not to begin by describ how the chang from timocraci to oligarchi aris ye well i said no ey ar requir in order to see how the on pass into the other how the accumul of gold in the treasuri of privat individu is the ruin of timocraci thei invent illeg mode of expenditur for what do thei or their wive care about the law ye inde and then on see anoth grow rich seek to rival him and thu the great mass of the citizen becom lover of monei like enough and so thei grow richer and richer and the more thei think of make a fortun the less thei think of virtu for when rich and virtu ar place togeth in the scale of the balanc the on alwai rise as the other fall true and in proport as rich and rich men ar honour in the state virtu and the virtuou ar dishonour clearli and what is honour is cultiv and that which ha no honour is neglect that is obviou and so at last instead of love content and glori men becom lover of trade and monei thei honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man thei do so thei next proce to make a law which fix a sum of monei as the qualif of citizenship the sum is higher in on place and lower in anoth as the oligarchi is more or less exclus and thei allow no on whose properti fall below the amount fix to have ani share in the govern these chang in the constitut thei effect by forc of arm if intimid ha not alreadi done their work veri true and thi speak gener is the wai in which oligarchi is establish ye he said but what ar the characterist of thi form of govern and what ar the defect of which we were speak first of all i said consid the natur of the qualif just think what would happen if pilot were to be chosen accord to their properti and a poor man were refus permiss to steer even though he were a better pilot you mean that thei would shipwreck ye and is not thi true of the govern of anyth i should imagin so except a cityor would you includ a citi nai he said the case of a citi is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a citi is the greatest and most difficult of all thi then will be the first great defect of oligarchi clearli and here is anoth defect which is quit as bad what defect the inevit divis such a state is not on but two state the on of poor the other of rich men and thei ar live on the same spot and alwai conspir against on anoth that sure is at least as bad anoth discredit featur is that for a like reason thei ar incap of carri on ani war either thei arm the multitud and then thei ar more afraid of them than of the enemi or if thei do not call them out in the hour of battl thei ar oligarch inde few to fight as thei ar few to rule and at the same time their fond for monei make them unwil to pai tax how discredit and as we said befor under such a constitut the same person have too mani callingsthei ar husbandmen tradesmen warrior all in on doe that look well anyth but well there is anoth evil which is perhap the greatest of all and to which thi state first begin to be liabl what evil a man mai sell all that he ha and anoth mai acquir hi properti yet after the sale he mai dwell in the citi of which he is no longer a part be neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplit but onli a poor helpless creatur ye that is an evil which also first begin in thi state the evil is certainli not prevent there for oligarchi have both the extrem of great wealth and utter poverti true but think again in hi wealthi dai while he wa spend hi monei wa a man of thi sort a whit more good to the state for the purpos of citizenship or did he onli seem to be a member of the rule bodi although in truth he wa neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift as you sai he seem to be a ruler but wa onli a spendthrift mai we not sai that thi is the drone in the hous who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the on is the plagu of the citi as the other is of the hive just so socrat and god ha made the fly drone adeimantu all without sting wherea of the walk drone he ha made some without sting but other have dread sting of the stingless class ar those who in their old ag end as pauper of the stinger come all the crimin class as thei ar term most true he said clearli then whenev you see pauper in a state somewher in that neighborhood there ar hidden awai thiev and cutpurs and robber of templ and all sort of malefactor clearli well i said and in oligarch state do you not find pauper ye he said nearli everybodi is a pauper who is not a ruler and mai we be so bold as to affirm that there ar also mani crimin to be found in them rogu who have sting and whom the author ar care to restrain by forc certainli we mai be so bold the exist of such person is to be attribut to want of educ illtrain and an evil constitut of the state true such then is the form and such ar the evil of oligarchi and there mai be mani other evil veri like then oligarchi or the form of govern in which the ruler ar elect for their wealth mai now be dismiss let us next proce to consid the natur and origin of the individu who answer to thi state by all mean doe not the timocrat man chang into the oligarch on thi wise how a time arriv when the repres of timocraci ha a son at first he begin by emul hi father and walk in hi footstep but present he see him of a sudden founder against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he ha is lost he mai have been a gener or some other high offic who is brought to trial under a prejudic rais by inform and either put to death or exil or depriv of the privileg of a citizen and all hi properti taken from him noth more like and the son ha seen and known all thish is a ruin man and hi fear ha taught him to knock ambit and passion headforemost from hi bosom throne humbl by poverti he take to moneymak and by mean and miserli save and hard work get a fortun togeth is not such an on like to seat the concupisc and covet element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to plai the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar most true he repli and when he ha made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obedi on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compel the on to think onli of how lesser sum mai be turn into larger on and will not allow the other to worship and admir anyth but rich and rich men or to be ambiti of anyth so much as the acquisit of wealth and the mean of acquir it of all chang he said there is none so speedi or so sure as the convers of the ambiti youth into the avarici on and the avarici i said is the oligarch youth ye he said at ani rate the individu out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchi came let us then consid whether there is ani like between them veri good first then thei resembl on anoth in the valu which thei set upon wealth certainli also in their penuri labori charact the individu onli satisfi hi necessari appetit and confin hi expenditur to them hi other desir he subdu under the idea that thei ar unprofit true he is a shabbi fellow who save someth out of everyth and make a purs for himself and thi is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a true imag of the state which he repres he appear to me to be so at ani rate monei is highli valu by him as well as by the state you see that he is not a man of cultiv i said i imagin not he said had he been educ he would never have made a blind god director of hi choru or given him chief honour excel i said yet consid must we not further admit that ow to thi want of cultiv there will be found in him dronelik desir as of pauper and rogu which ar forcibl kept down by hi gener habit of life true do you know where you will have to look if you want to discov hi rogueri where must i look you should see him where he ha some great opportun of act dishonestli as in the guardianship of an orphan ay it will be clear enough then that in hi ordinari deal which give him a reput for honesti he coerc hi bad passion by an enforc virtu not make them see that thei ar wrong or tame them by reason but by necess and fear constrain them and becaus he trembl for hi possess to be sure ye inde my dear friend but you will find that the natur desir of the drone commonli exist in him all the same whenev he ha to spend what is not hi own ye and thei will be strong in him too the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not on but in gener hi better desir will be found to prevail over hi inferior on true for these reason such an on will be more respect than most peopl yet the true virtu of a unanim and harmoni soul will flee far awai and never come near him i should expect so and sure the miser individu will be an ignobl competitor in a state for ani prize of victori or other object of honour ambit he will not spend hi monei in the contest for glori so afraid is he of awaken hi expens appetit and invit them to help and join in the struggl in true oligarch fashion he fight with a small part onli of hi resourc and the result commonli is that he lose the prize and save hi monei veri true can we ani longer doubt then that the miser and moneymak answer to the oligarch state there can be no doubt next come democraci of thi the origin and natur have still to be consid by us and then we will enquir into the wai of the democrat man and bring him up for judgment that he said is our method well i said and how doe the chang from oligarchi into democraci aris is it not on thi wiseth good at which such a state aim is to becom as rich as possibl a desir which is insati what then the ruler be awar that their power rest upon their wealth refus to curtail by law the extravag of the spendthrift youth becaus thei gain by their ruin thei take interest from them and bui up their estat and thu increas their own wealth and import to be sure there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moder cannot exist togeth in citizen of the same state to ani consider extent on or the other will be disregard that is toler clear and in oligarch state from the gener spread of careless and extravag men of good famili have often been reduc to beggari ye often and still thei remain in the citi there thei ar readi to sting and fulli arm and some of them ow monei some have forfeit their citizenship a third class ar in both predica and thei hate and conspir against those who have got their properti and against everybodi els and ar eager for revolut that is true on the other hand the men of busi stoop as thei walk and pretend not even to see those whom thei have alreadi ruin insert their stingthat is their moneyinto some on els who is not on hi guard against them and recov the parent sum mani time over multipli into a famili of children and so thei make drone and pauper to abound in the state ye he said there ar plenti of themthat is certain the evil blaze up like a fire and thei will not extinguish it either by restrict a man us of hi own properti or by anoth remedi what other on which is the next best and ha the advantag of compel the citizen to look to their characterslet there be a gener rule that everi on shall enter into voluntari contract at hi own risk and there will be less of thi scandal moneymak and the evil of which we were speak will be greatli lessen in the state ye thei will be greatli lessen at present the governor induc by the motiv which i have name treat their subject badli while thei and their adher especi the young men of the govern class ar habitu to lead a life of luxuri and idl both of bodi and mind thei do noth and ar incap of resist either pleasur or pain veri true thei themselv care onli for make monei and ar as indiffer as the pauper to the cultiv of virtu ye quit as indiffer such is the state of affair which prevail among them and often ruler and their subject mai come in on anoth wai whether on a journei or on some other occas of meet on a pilgrimag or a march as fellowsoldi or fellowsailor ay and thei mai observ the behaviour of each other in the veri moment of dangerfor where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despis by the richand veri like the wiri sunburnt poor man mai be place in battl at the side of a wealthi on who ha never spoilt hi complexion and ha plenti of superflu fleshwhen he see such an on puf and at hi witsend how can he avoid draw the conclus that men like him ar onli rich becaus no on ha the courag to despoil them and when thei meet in privat will not peopl be sai to on anoth our warrior ar not good for much ye he said i am quit awar that thi is their wai of talk and as in a bodi which is diseas the addit of a touch from without mai bring on ill and sometim even when there is no extern provoc a commot mai aris withinin the same wai wherev there is weak in the state there is also like to be ill of which the occas mai be veri slight the on parti introduc from without their oligarch the other their democrat alli and then the state fall sick and is at war with herself and mai be at time distract even when there is no extern caus ye sure and then democraci come into be after the poor have conquer their oppon slaughter some and banish some while to the remaind thei give an equal share of freedom and power and thi is the form of govern in which the magistr ar commonli elect by lot ye he said that is the natur of democraci whether the revolut ha been effect by arm or whether fear ha caus the opposit parti to withdraw and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a govern have thei for as the govern is such will be the man clearli he said in the first place ar thei not free and is not the citi full of freedom and franknessa man mai sai and do what he like ti said so he repli and where freedom is the individu is clearli abl to order for himself hi own life as he pleas clearli then in thi kind of state there will be the greatest varieti of human natur there will thi then seem like to be the fairest of state be like an embroid robe which is spangl with everi sort of flower and just as women and children think a varieti of colour to be of all thing most charm so there ar mani men to whom thi state which is spangl with the manner and charact of mankind will appear to be the fairest of state ye ye my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a govern why becaus of the liberti which reign therethei have a complet assort of constitut and he who ha a mind to establish a state as we have been do must go to a democraci as he would to a bazaar at which thei sell them and pick out the on that suit him then when he ha made hi choic he mai found hi state he will be sure to have pattern enough and there be no necess i said for you to govern in thi state even if you have the capac or to be govern unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peac when other ar at peac unless you ar so disposedther be no necess also becaus some law forbid you to hold offic or be a dicast that you should not hold offic or be a dicast if you have a fancyi not thi a wai of life which for the moment is suprem delight for the moment ye and is not their human to the condemn in some case quit charm have you not observ how in a democraci mani person although thei have been sentenc to death or exil just stai where thei ar and walk about the worldth gentleman parad like a hero and nobodi see or care ye he repli mani and mani a on see too i said the forgiv spirit of democraci and the dont care about trifl and the disregard which she show of all the fine principl which we solemnli laid down at the foundat of the citya when we said that except in the case of some rare gift natur there never will be a good man who ha not from hi childhood been us to plai amid thing of beauti and make of them a joi and a studyhow grandli doe she trampl all these fine notion of our under her feet never give a thought to the pursuit which make a statesman and promot to honour ani on who profess to be the peopl friend ye she is of a nobl spirit these and other kindr characterist ar proper to democraci which is a charm form of govern full of varieti and disord and dispens a sort of equal to equal and unequ alik we know her well consid now i said what manner of man the individu is or rather consid as in the case of the state how he come into be veri good he said is not thi the wayh is the son of the miserli and oligarch father who ha train him in hi own habit exactli and like hi father he keep under by forc the pleasur which ar of the spend and not of the get sort be those which ar call unnecessari obvious would you like for the sake of clear to distinguish which ar the necessari and which ar the unnecessari pleasur i should ar not necessari pleasur those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfact is a benefit to us and thei ar rightli call so becaus we ar frame by natur to desir both what is benefici and what is necessari and cannot help it true we ar not wrong therefor in call them necessari we ar not and the desir of which a man mai get rid if he take pain from hi youth upwardsof which the presenc moreov doe no good and in some case the revers of goodshal we not be right in sai that all these ar unnecessari ye certainli suppos we select an exampl of either kind in order that we mai have a gener notion of them veri good will not the desir of eat that is of simpl food and condiment in so far as thei ar requir for health and strength be of the necessari class that is what i should suppos the pleasur of eat is necessari in two wai it doe us good and it is essenti to the continu of life ye but the condiment ar onli necessari in so far as thei ar good for health certainli and the desir which goe beyond thi of more delic food or other luxuri which might gener be got rid of if control and train in youth and is hurt to the bodi and hurt to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtu mai be rightli call unnecessari veri true mai we not sai that these desir spend and that the other make monei becaus thei conduc to product certainli and of the pleasur of love and all other pleasur the same hold good true and the drone of whom we spoke wa he who wa surfeit in pleasur and desir of thi sort and wa the slave of the unnecessari desir wherea he who wa subject to the necessari onli wa miserli and oligarch veri true again let us see how the democrat man grow out of the oligarch the follow as i suspect is commonli the process what is the process when a young man who ha been brought up as we were just now describ in a vulgar and miserli wai ha tast drone honei and ha come to associ with fierc and crafti natur who ar abl to provid for him all sort of refin and varieti of pleasurethen as you mai imagin the chang will begin of the oligarch principl within him into the democrat inevit and as in the citi like wa help like and the chang wa effect by an allianc from without assist on divis of the citizen so too the young man is chang by a class of desir come from without to assist the desir within him that which is akin and alik again help that which is akin and alik certainli and if there be ani alli which aid the oligarch principl within him whether the influenc of a father or of kindr advis or rebuk him then there aris in hi soul a faction and an opposit faction and he goe to war with himself it must be so and there ar time when the democrat principl give wai to the oligarch and some of hi desir die and other ar banish a spirit of rever enter into the young man soul and order is restor ye he said that sometim happen and then again after the old desir have been driven out fresh on spring up which ar akin to them and becaus he their father doe not know how to educ them wax fierc and numer ye he said that is apt to be the wai thei draw him to hi old associ and hold secret intercours with them breed and multipli in him veri true at length thei seiz upon the citadel of the young man soul which thei perceiv to be void of all accomplish and fair pursuit and true word which make their abod in the mind of men who ar dear to the god and ar their best guardian and sentinel none better fals and boast conceit and phrase mount upward and take their place thei ar certain to do so and so the young man return into the countri of the lotuseat and take up hi dwell there in the face of all men and if ani help be sent by hi friend to the oligarch part of him the aforesaid vain conceit shut the gate of the king fast and thei will neither allow the embassi itself to enter nor if privat advis offer the fatherli counsel of the ag will thei listen to them or receiv them there is a battl and thei gain the dai and then modesti which thei call silli is ignomini thrust into exil by them and temper which thei nicknam unmanli is trampl in the mire and cast forth thei persuad men that moder and orderli expenditur ar vulgar and mean and so by the help of a rabbl of evil appetit thei drive them beyond the border ye with a will and when thei have empti and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is be initi by them in great mysteri the next thing is to bring back to their hous insol and anarchi and wast and impud in bright arrai have garland on their head and a great compani with them hymn their prais and call them by sweet name insol thei term breed and anarchi liberti and wast magnific and impud courag and so the young man pass out of hi origin natur which wa train in the school of necess into the freedom and libertin of useless and unnecessari pleasur ye he said the chang in him is visibl enough after thi he live on spend hi monei and labour and time on unnecessari pleasur quit as much as on necessari on but if he be fortun and is not too much disord in hi wit when year have elaps and the heydai of passion is oversuppos that he then readmit into the citi some part of the exil virtu and doe not wholli give himself up to their successorsin that case he balanc hi pleasur and live in a sort of equilibrium put the govern of himself into the hand of the on which come first and win the turn and when he ha had enough of that then into the hand of anoth he despis none of them but encourag them all equal veri true he said neither doe he receiv or let pass into the fortress ani true word of advic if ani on sai to him that some pleasur ar the satisfact of good and nobl desir and other of evil desir and that he ought to us and honour some and chastis and master the otherswhenev thi is repeat to him he shake hi head and sai that thei ar all alik and that on is as good as anoth ye he said that is the wai with him ye i said he live from dai to dai indulg the appetit of the hour and sometim he is lap in drink and strain of the flute then he becom a waterdrink and tri to get thin then he take a turn at gymnast sometim idl and neglect everyth then onc more live the life of a philosoph often he is busi with polit and start to hi feet and sai and doe whatev come into hi head and if he is emul of ani on who is a warrior off he is in that direct or of men of busi onc more in that hi life ha neither law nor order and thi distract exist he term joi and bliss and freedom and so he goe on ye he repli he is all liberti and equal ye i said hi life is motlei and manifold and an epitom of the live of manyh answer to the state which we describ as fair and spangl and mani a man and mani a woman will take him for their pattern and mani a constitut and mani an exampl of manner is contain in him just so let him then be set over against democraci he mai truli be call the democrat man let that be hi place he said last of all come the most beauti of all man and state alik tyranni and the tyrant these we have now to consid quit true he said sai then my friend in what manner doe tyranni arisethat it ha a democrat origin is evid clearli and doe not tyranni spring from democraci in the same manner as democraci from oligarchyi mean after a sort how the good which oligarchi propos to itself and the mean by which it wa maintain wa excess of wealtham i not right ye and the insati desir of wealth and the neglect of all other thing for the sake of moneyget wa also the ruin of oligarchi true and democraci ha her own good of which the insati desir bring her to dissolut what good freedom i repli which as thei tell you in a democraci is the glori of the stateand that therefor in a democraci alon will the freeman of natur deign to dwell ye the sai is in everi bodi mouth i wa go to observ that the insati desir of thi and the neglect of other thing introduc the chang in democraci which occas a demand for tyranni how so when a democraci which is thirst for freedom ha evil cupbear presid over the feast and ha drunk too deepli of the strong wine of freedom then unless her ruler ar veri amen and give a plenti draught she call them to account and punish them and sai that thei ar curs oligarch ye he repli a veri common occurr ye i said and loyal citizen ar insultingli term by her slave who hug their chain and men of naught she would have subject who ar like ruler and ruler who ar like subject these ar men after her own heart whom she prais and honour both in privat and public now in such a state can liberti have ani limit certainli not by degre the anarchi find a wai into privat hous and end by get among the anim and infect them how do you mean i mean that the father grow accustom to descend to the level of hi son and to fear them and the son is on a level with hi father he have no respect or rever for either of hi parent and thi is hi freedom and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quit as good as either ye he said that is the wai and these ar not the onli evil i saidther ar sever lesser on in such a state of societi the master fear and flatter hi scholar and the scholar despis their master and tutor young and old ar all alik and the young man is on a level with the old and is readi to compet with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and ar full of pleasantri and gaieti thei ar loth to be thought moros and authorit and therefor thei adopt the manner of the young quit true he said the last extrem of popular liberti is when the slave bought with monei whether male or femal is just as free as hi or her purchas nor must i forget to tell of the liberti and equal of the two sex in relat to each other why not as aeschylu sai utter the word which rise to our lip that is what i am do i repli and i must add that no on who doe not know would believ how much greater is the liberti which the anim who ar under the dominion of man have in a democraci than in ani other state for truli the shedog as the proverb sai ar as good as their shemistress and the hors and ass have a wai of march along with all the right and digniti of freemen and thei will run at ani bodi who come in their wai if he doe not leav the road clear for them and all thing ar just readi to burst with liberti when i take a countri walk he said i often experi what you describ you and i have dream the same thing and abov all i said and as the result of all see how sensit the citizen becom thei chafe impati at the least touch of author and at length as you know thei ceas to care even for the law written or unwritten thei will have no on over them ye he said i know it too well such my friend i said is the fair and gloriou begin out of which spring tyranni gloriou inde he said but what is the next step the ruin of oligarchi is the ruin of democraci the same diseas magnifi and intensifi by liberti overmast democracyth truth be that the excess increas of anyth often caus a reaction in the opposit direct and thi is the case not onli in the season and in veget and anim life but abov all in form of govern true the excess of liberti whether in state or individu seem onli to pass into excess of slaveri ye the natur order and so tyranni natur aris out of democraci and the most aggrav form of tyranni and slaveri out of the most extrem form of liberti as we might expect that howev wa not as i believ your questiony rather desir to know what is that disord which is gener alik in oligarchi and democraci and is the ruin of both just so he repli well i said i meant to refer to the class of idl spendthrift of whom the more courag ar the leader and the more timid the follow the same whom we were compar to drone some stingless and other have sting a veri just comparison these two class ar the plagu of everi citi in which thei ar gener be what phlegm and bile ar to the bodi and the good physician and lawgiv of the state ought like the wise beemast to keep them at a distanc and prevent if possibl their ever come in and if thei have anyhow found a wai in then he should have them and their cell cut out as speedili as possibl ye by all mean he said then in order that we mai see clearli what we ar do let us imagin democraci to be divid as inde it is into three class for in the first place freedom creat rather more drone in the democrat than there were in the oligarch state that is true and in the democraci thei ar certainli more intensifi how so becaus in the oligarch state thei ar disqualifi and driven from offic and therefor thei cannot train or gather strength wherea in a democraci thei ar almost the entir rule power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzz about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side henc in democraci almost everyth is manag by the drone veri true he said then there is anoth class which is alwai be sever from the mass what is that thei ar the orderli class which in a nation of trader is sure to be the richest natur so thei ar the most squeezabl person and yield the largest amount of honei to the drone why he said there is littl to be squeez out of peopl who have littl and thi is call the wealthi class and the drone feed upon them that is pretti much the case he said the peopl ar a third class consist of those who work with their own hand thei ar not politician and have not much to live upon thi when assembl is the largest and most power class in a democraci true he said but then the multitud is seldom will to congreg unless thei get a littl honei and do thei not share i said do not their leader depriv the rich of their estat and distribut them among the peopl at the same time take care to reserv the larger part for themselv why ye he said to that extent the peopl do share and the person whose properti is taken from them ar compel to defend themselv befor the peopl as thei best can what els can thei do and then although thei mai have no desir of chang the other charg them with plot against the peopl and be friend of oligarchi true and the end is that when thei see the peopl not of their own accord but through ignor and becaus thei ar deceiv by inform seek to do them wrong then at last thei ar forc to becom oligarch in realiti thei do not wish to be but the sting of the drone torment them and breed revolut in them that is exactli the truth then come impeach and judgment and trial of on anoth true the peopl have alwai some champion whom thei set over them and nurs into great ye that is their wai thi and no other is the root from which a tyrant spring when he first appear abov ground he is a protector ye that is quit clear how then doe a protector begin to chang into a tyrant clearli when he doe what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian templ of lycaean zeu what tale the tale is that he who ha tast the entrail of a singl human victim minc up with the entrail of other victim is destin to becom a wolf did you never hear it oh ye and the protector of the peopl is like him have a mob entir at hi dispos he is not restrain from shed the blood of kinsmen by the favourit method of fals accus he bring them into court and murder them make the life of man to disappear and with unholi tongu and lip tast the blood of hi fellow citizen some he kill and other he banish at the same time hint at the abolit of debt and partit of land and after thi what will be hi destini must he not either perish at the hand of hi enemi or from be a man becom a wolfthat is a tyrant inevit thi i said is he who begin to make a parti against the rich the same after a while he is driven out but come back in spite of hi enemi a tyrant full grown that is clear and if thei ar unabl to expel him or to get him condemn to death by a public accus thei conspir to assassin him ye he said that is their usual wai then come the famou request for a bodyguard which is the devic of all those who have got thu far in their tyrann careerlet not the peopl friend as thei sai be lost to them exactli the peopl readili assent all their fear ar for himthei have none for themselv veri true and when a man who is wealthi and is also accus of be an enemi of the peopl see thi then my friend as the oracl said to croesu by pebbl hermu shore he flee and rest not and is not asham to be a coward and quit right too said he for if he were he would never be asham again but if he is caught he di of cours and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not lard the plain with hi bulk but himself the overthrow of mani stand up in the chariot of state with the rein in hi hand no longer protector but tyrant absolut no doubt he said and now let us consid the happi of the man and also of the state in which a creatur like him is gener ye he said let us consid that at first in the earli dai of hi power he is full of smile and he salut everi on whom he meetsh to be call a tyrant who is make promis in public and also in privat liber debtor and distribut land to the peopl and hi follow and want to be so kind and good to everi on of cours he said but when he ha dispos of foreign enemi by conquest or treati and there is noth to fear from them then he is alwai stir up some war or other in order that the peopl mai requir a leader to be sure ha he not also anoth object which is that thei mai be impoverish by payment of tax and thu compel to devot themselv to their daili want and therefor less like to conspir against him clearli and if ani of them ar suspect by him of have notion of freedom and of resist to hi author he will have a good pretext for destroi them by place them at the merci of the enemi and for all these reason the tyrant must be alwai get up a war he must now he begin to grow unpopular a necessari result then some of those who join in set him up and who ar in power speak their mind to him and to on anoth and the more courag of them cast in hi teeth what is be done ye that mai be expect and the tyrant if he mean to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he ha a friend or an enemi who is good for anyth he cannot and therefor he must look about him and see who is valiant who is highmind who is wise who is wealthi happi man he is the enemi of them all and must seek occas against them whether he will or no until he ha made a purgat of the state ye he said and a rare purgat ye i said not the sort of purgat which the physician make of the bodi for thei take awai the wors and leav the better part but he doe the revers if he is to rule i suppos that he cannot help himself what a bless altern i saidto be compel to dwell onli with the mani bad and to be by them hate or not to live at all ye that is the altern and the more detest hi action ar to the citizen the more satellit and the greater devot in them will he requir certainli and who ar the devot band and where will he procur them thei will flock to him he said of their own accord if he pai them by the dog i said here ar more drone of everi sort and from everi land ye he said there ar but will he not desir to get them on the spot how do you mean he will rob the citizen of their slave he will then set them free and enrol them in hi bodyguard to be sure he said and he will be abl to trust them best of all what a bless creatur i said must thi tyrant be he ha put to death the other and ha these for hi trust friend ye he said thei ar quit of hi sort ye i said and these ar the new citizen whom he ha call into exist who admir him and ar hi companion while the good hate and avoid him of cours verili then tragedi is a wise thing and euripid a great tragedian why so why becaus he is the author of the pregnant sai tyrant ar wise by live with the wise and he clearli meant to sai that thei ar the wise whom the tyrant make hi companion ye he said and he also prais tyranni as godlik and mani other thing of the same kind ar said by him and by the other poet and therefor i said the tragic poet be wise men will forgiv us and ani other who live after our manner if we do not receiv them into our state becaus thei ar the eulogist of tyranni ye he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgiv us but thei will continu to go to other citi and attract mob and hire voic fair and loud and persuas and draw the citi over to tyranni and democraci veri true moreov thei ar paid for thi and receiv honourth greatest honour as might be expect from tyrant and the next greatest from democraci but the higher thei ascend our constitut hill the more their reput fail and seem unabl from short of breath to proce further true but we ar wander from the subject let us therefor return and enquir how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numer and variou and everchang armi of hi if he said there ar sacr treasur in the citi he will confisc and spend them and in so far as the fortun of attaint person mai suffic he will be abl to diminish the tax which he would otherwis have to impos upon the peopl and when these fail why clearli he said then he and hi boon companion whether male or femal will be maintain out of hi father estat you mean to sai that the peopl from whom he ha deriv hi be will maintain him and hi companion ye he said thei cannot help themselv but what if the peopl fly into a passion and aver that a grownup son ought not to be support by hi father but that the father should be support by the son the father did not bring him into be or settl him in life in order that when hi son becam a man he should himself be the servant of hi own servant and should support him and hi rabbl of slave and companion but that hi son should protect him and that by hi help he might be emancip from the govern of the rich and aristocrat as thei ar term and so he bid him and hi companion depart just as ani other father might drive out of the hous a riotou son and hi undesir associ by heaven he said then the parent will discov what a monster he ha been foster in hi bosom and when he want to drive him out he will find that he is weak and hi son strong why you do not mean to sai that the tyrant will us violenc what beat hi father if he oppos him ye he will have first disarm him then he is a parricid and a cruel guardian of an ag parent and thi is real tyranni about which there can be no longer a mistak as the sai is the peopl who would escap the smoke which is the slaveri of freemen ha fallen into the fire which is the tyranni of slave thu liberti get out of all order and reason pass into the harshest and bitterest form of slaveri true he said veri well and mai we not rightli sai that we have suffici discuss the natur of tyranni and the manner of the transit from democraci to tyranni ye quit enough he said book ix last of all come the tyrann man about whom we have onc more to ask how is he form out of the democrat and how doe he live in happi or in miseri ye he said he is the onli on remain there is howev i said a previou question which remain unansw what question i do not think that we have adequ determin the natur and number of the appetit and until thi is accomplish the enquiri will alwai be confus well he said it is not too late to suppli the omiss veri true i said and observ the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessari pleasur and appetit i conceiv to be unlaw everi on appear to have them but in some person thei ar control by the law and by reason and the better desir prevail over themeith thei ar wholli banish or thei becom few and weak while in the case of other thei ar stronger and there ar more of them which appetit do you mean i mean those which ar awak when the reason and human and rule power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorg with meat or drink start up and have shaken off sleep goe forth to satisfi hi desir and there is no conceiv folli or crimenot except incest or ani other unnatur union or parricid or the eat of forbidden foodwhich at such a time when he ha part compani with all shame and sens a man mai not be readi to commit most true he said but when a man puls is healthi and temper and when befor go to sleep he ha awaken hi ration power and fed them on nobl thought and enquiri collect himself in medit after have first indulg hi appetit neither too much nor too littl but just enough to lai them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoy and pain from interf with the higher principlewhich he leav in the solitud of pure abstract free to contempl and aspir to the knowledg of the unknown whether in past present or futur when again he ha allai the passion element if he ha a quarrel against ani onei sai when after pacifi the two irrat principl he rous up the third which is reason befor he take hi rest then as you know he attain truth most nearli and is least like to be the sport of fantast and lawless vision i quit agre in sai thi i have been run into a digress but the point which i desir to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless wildbeast natur which peer out in sleep prai consid whether i am right and you agre with me ye i agre and now rememb the charact which we attribut to the democrat man he wa suppos from hi youth upward to have been train under a miserli parent who encourag the save appetit in him but discountenanc the unnecessari which aim onli at amus and ornament true and then he got into the compani of a more refin licenti sort of peopl and take to all their wanton wai rush into the opposit extrem from an abhorr of hi father mean at last be a better man than hi corruptor he wa drawn in both direct until he halt midwai and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deem moder indulg in variou pleasur after thi manner the democrat wa gener out of the oligarch ye he said that wa our view of him and is so still and now i said year will have pass awai and you must conceiv thi man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in hi father principl i can imagin him then you must further imagin the same thing to happen to the son which ha alreadi happen to the fatherh is drawn into a perfectli lawless life which by hi seduc is term perfect liberti and hi father and friend take part with hi moder desir and the opposit parti assist the opposit on as soon as these dire magician and tyrantmak find that thei ar lose their hold on him thei contriv to implant in him a master passion to be lord over hi idl and spendthrift lustsa sort of monstrou wing dronethat is the onli imag which will adequ describ him ye he said that is the onli adequ imag of him and when hi other lust amid cloud of incens and perfum and garland and wine and all the pleasur of a dissolut life now let loos come buzz around him nourish to the utmost the sting of desir which thei implant in hi dronelik natur then at last thi lord of the soul have mad for the captain of hi guard break out into a frenzi and if he find in himself ani good opinion or appetit in process of format and there is in him ani sens of shame remain to these better principl he put an end and cast them forth until he ha purg awai temper and brought in mad to the full ye he said that is the wai in which the tyrann man is gener and is not thi the reason why of old love ha been call a tyrant i should not wonder further i said ha not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant he ha and you know that a man who is derang and not right in hi mind will fanci that he is abl to rule not onli over men but also over the god that he will and the tyrann man in the true sens of the word come into be when either under the influenc of natur or habit or both he becom drunken lust passion o my friend is not that so assuredli such is the man and such is hi origin and next how doe he live suppos as peopl faceti sai you were to tell me i imagin i said at the next step in hi progress that there will be feast and carous and revel and courtezan and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the hous within him and order all the concern of hi soul that is certain ye and everi dai and everi night desir grow up mani and formid and their demand ar mani thei ar inde he said hi revenu if he ha ani ar soon spent true then come debt and the cut down of hi properti of cours when he ha noth left must not hi desir crowd in the nest like young raven be cry aloud for food and he goad on by them and especi by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzi and would fain discov whom he can defraud or despoil of hi properti in order that he mai gratifi them ye that is sure to be the case he must have monei no matter how if he is to escap horrid pain and pang he must and as in himself there wa a success of pleasur and the new got the better of the old and took awai their right so he be younger will claim to have more than hi father and hi mother and if he ha spent hi own share of the properti he will take a slice of their no doubt he will and if hi parent will not give wai then he will try first of all to cheat and deceiv them veri true and if he fail then he will us forc and plunder them ye probabl and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creatur feel ani compunct at tyrann over them nai he said i should not feel at all comfort about hi parent but o heaven adeimantu on account of some newfangl love of a harlot who is anyth but a necessari connect can you believ that he would strike the mother who is hi ancient friend and necessari to hi veri exist and would place her under the author of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumst he would do the same to hi wither old father first and most indispens of friend for the sake of some newlyfound bloom youth who is the revers of indispens ye inde he said i believ that he would truli then i said a tyrann son is a bless to hi father and mother he is inde he repli he first take their properti and when that fail and pleasur ar begin to swarm in the hive of hi soul then he break into a hous or steal the garment of some nightli wayfar next he proce to clear a templ meanwhil the old opinion which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil ar overthrown by those other which have just been emancip and ar now the bodyguard of love and share hi empir these in hi democrat dai when he wa still subject to the law and to hi father were onli let loos in the dream of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becom alwai and in wake realiti what he wa then veri rare and in a dream onli he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilti of ani other horrid act love is hi tyrant and live lordli in him and lawlessli and be himself a king lead him on as a tyrant lead a state to the perform of ani reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabbl of hi associ whether those whom evil commun have brought in from without or those whom he himself ha allow to break loos within him by reason of a similar evil natur in himself have we not here a pictur of hi wai of life ye inde he said and if there ar onli a few of them in the state and the rest of the peopl ar well dispos thei go awai and becom the bodyguard or mercenari soldier of some other tyrant who mai probabl want them for a war and if there is no war thei stai at home and do mani littl piec of mischief in the citi what sort of mischief for exampl thei ar the thiev burglar cutpurs footpad robber of templ mansteal of the commun or if thei ar abl to speak thei turn inform and bear fals wit and take bribe a small catalogu of evil even if the perpetr of them ar few in number ye i said but small and great ar compar term and all these thing in the miseri and evil which thei inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand mile of the tyrant when thi noxiou class and their follow grow numer and becom consciou of their strength assist by the infatu of the peopl thei choos from among themselv the on who ha most of the tyrant in hi own soul and him thei creat their tyrant ye he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant if the peopl yield well and good but if thei resist him as he began by beat hi own father and mother so now if he ha the power he beat them and will keep hi dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretan sai in subject to hi young retain whom he ha introduc to be their ruler and master thi is the end of hi passion and desir exactli when such men ar onli privat individu and befor thei get power thi is their charact thei associ entir with their own flatter or readi tool or if thei want anyth from anybodi thei in their turn ar equal readi to bow down befor them thei profess everi sort of affect for them but when thei have gain their point thei know them no more ye truli thei ar alwai either the master or servant and never the friend of anybodi the tyrant never tast of true freedom or friendship certainli not and mai we not rightli call such men treacher no question also thei ar utterli unjust if we were right in our notion of justic ye he said and we were perfectli right let us then sum up in a word i said the charact of the worst man he is the wake realiti of what we dream most true and thi is he who be by natur most of a tyrant bear rule and the longer he live the more of a tyrant he becom that is certain said glaucon take hi turn to answer and will not he who ha been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miser and he who ha tyrann longest and most most continu and truli miser although thi mai not be the opinion of men in gener ye he said inevit and must not the tyrann man be like the tyrann state and the democrat man like the democrat state and the same of the other certainli and as state is to state in virtu and happi so is man in relat to man to be sure then compar our origin citi which wa under a king and the citi which is under a tyrant how do thei stand as to virtu thei ar the opposit extrem he said for on is the veri best and the other is the veri worst there can be no mistak i said as to which is which and therefor i will at onc enquir whether you would arriv at a similar decis about their rel happi and miseri and here we must not allow ourselv to be panicstricken at the apparit of the tyrant who is onli a unit and mai perhap have a few retain about him but let us go as we ought into everi corner of the citi and look all about and then we will give our opinion a fair invit he repli and i see as everi on must that a tyranni is the wretchedest form of govern and the rule of a king the happiest and in estim the men too mai i not fairli make a like request that i should have a judg whose mind can enter into and see through human natur he must not be like a child who look at the outsid and is dazzl at the pompou aspect which the tyrann natur assum to the behold but let him be on who ha a clear insight mai i suppos that the judgment is given in the hear of us all by on who is abl to judg and ha dwelt in the same place with him and been present at hi dalli life and known him in hi famili relat where he mai be seen strip of hi tragedi attir and again in the hour of public dangerh shall tell us about the happi and miseri of the tyrant when compar with other men that again he said is a veri fair propos shall i assum that we ourselv ar abl and experienc judg and have befor now met with such a person we shall then have some on who will answer our enquiri by all mean let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individu and the state bear thi in mind and glanc in turn from on to the other of them will you tell me their respect condit what do you mean he ask begin with the state i repli would you sai that a citi which is govern by a tyrant is free or enslav no citi he said can be more complet enslav and yet as you see there ar freemen as well as master in such a state ye he said i see that there area few but the peopl speak gener and the best of them ar miser degrad and enslav then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail hi soul is full of mean and vulgarityth best element in him ar enslav and there is a small rule part which is also the worst and maddest inevit and would you sai that the soul of such an on is the soul of a freeman or of a slave he ha the soul of a slave in my opinion and the state which is enslav under a tyrant is utterli incap of act voluntarili utterli incap and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speak of the soul taken as a whole is least capabl of do what she desir there is a gadfli which goad her and she is full of troubl and remors certainli and is the citi which is under a tyrant rich or poor poor and the tyrann soul must be alwai poor and insati true and must not such a state and such a man be alwai full of fear ye inde is there ani state in which you will find more of lament and sorrow and groan and pain certainli not and is there ani man in whom you will find more of thi sort of miseri than in the tyrann man who is in a furi of passion and desir imposs reflect upon these and similar evil you held the tyrann state to be the most miser of state and i wa right he said certainli i said and when you see the same evil in the tyrann man what do you sai of him i sai that he is by far the most miser of all men there i said i think that you ar begin to go wrong what do you mean i do not think that he ha as yet reach the utmost extrem of miseri then who is more miser on of whom i am about to speak who is that he who is of a tyrann natur and instead of lead a privat life ha been curs with the further misfortun of be a public tyrant from what ha been said i gather that you ar right ye i repli but in thi high argument you should be a littl more certain and should not conjectur onli for of all question thi respect good and evil is the greatest veri true he said let me then offer you an illustr which mai i think throw a light upon thi subject what is your illustr the case of rich individu in citi who possess mani slave from them you mai form an idea of the tyrant condit for thei both have slave the onli differ is that he ha more slave ye that is the differ you know that thei live secur and have noth to apprehend from their servant what should thei fear noth but do you observ the reason of thi ye the reason is that the whole citi is leagu togeth for the protect of each individu veri true i said but imagin on of these owner the master sai of some fifti slave togeth with hi famili and properti and slave carri off by a god into the wilder where there ar no freemen to help himwil he not be in an agoni of fear lest he and hi wife and children should be put to death by hi slave ye he said he will be in the utmost fear the time ha arriv when he will be compel to flatter diver of hi slave and make mani promis to them of freedom and other thing much against hi willh will have to cajol hi own servant ye he said that will be the onli wai of save himself and suppos the same god who carri him awai to surround him with neighbour who will not suffer on man to be the master of anoth and who if thei could catch the offend would take hi life hi case will be still wors if you suppos him to be everywher surround and watch by enemi and is not thi the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be boundh who be by natur such as we have describ is full of all sort of fear and lust hi soul is dainti and greedi and yet alon of all men in the citi he is never allow to go on a journei or to see the thing which other freemen desir to see but he live in hi hole like a woman hidden in the hous and is jealou of ani other citizen who goe into foreign part and see anyth of interest veri true he said and amid evil such as these will not he who is illgovern in hi own personth tyrann man i meanwhom you just now decid to be the most miser of allwil not he be yet more miser when instead of lead a privat life he is constrain by fortun to be a public tyrant he ha to be master of other when he is not master of himself he is like a diseas or paralyt man who is compel to pass hi life not in retir but fight and combat with other men ye he said the similitud is most exact is not hi case utterli miser and doe not the actual tyrant lead a wors life than he whose life you determin to be the worst certainli he who is the real tyrant whatev men mai think is the real slave and is oblig to practis the greatest adul and servil and to be the flatter of the vilest of mankind he ha desir which he is utterli unabl to satisfi and ha more want than ani on and is truli poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all hi life long he is beset with fear and is full of convuls and distract even as the state which he resembl and sure the resembl hold veri true he said moreov as we were sai befor he grow wors from have power he becom and is of necess more jealou more faithless more unjust more friendless more impiou than he wa at first he is the purveyor and cherish of everi sort of vice and the consequ is that he is suprem miser and that he make everybodi els as miser as himself no man of ani sens will disput your word come then i said and as the gener umpir in theatric contest proclaim the result do you also decid who in your opinion is first in the scale of happi and who second and in what order the other follow there ar five of them in allthei ar the royal timocrat oligarch democrat tyrann the decis will be easili given he repli thei shall be chorus come on the stage and i must judg them in the order in which thei enter by the criterion of virtu and vice happi and miseri need we hire a herald or shall i announc that the son of ariston the best ha decid that the best and justest is also the happiest and that thi is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miser and that thi is he who be the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of hi state make the proclam yourself he said and shall i add whether seen or unseen by god and men let the word be ad then thi i said will be our first proof and there is anoth which mai also have some weight what is that the second proof is deriv from the natur of the soul see that the individu soul like the state ha been divid by us into three principl the divis mai i think furnish a new demonstr of what natur it seem to me that to these three principl three pleasur correspond also three desir and govern power how do you mean he said there is on principl with which as we were sai a man learn anoth with which he is angri the third have mani form ha no special name but is denot by the gener term appetit from the extraordinari strength and vehem of the desir of eat and drink and the other sensual appetit which ar the main element of it also moneylov becaus such desir ar gener satisfi by the help of monei that is true he said if we were to sai that the love and pleasur of thi third part were concern with gain we should then be abl to fall back on a singl notion and might truli and intellig describ thi part of the soul as love gain or monei i agre with you again is not the passion element wholli set on rule and conquer and get fame true suppos we call it the contenti or ambitiouswould the term be suitabl extrem suitabl on the other hand everi on see that the principl of knowledg is wholli direct to the truth and care less than either of the other for gain or fame far less lover of wisdom lover of knowledg ar titl which we mai fitli appli to that part of the soul certainli on principl prevail in the soul of on class of men anoth in other as mai happen ye then we mai begin by assum that there ar three class of menlov of wisdom lover of honour lover of gain exactli and there ar three kind of pleasur which ar their sever object veri true now if you examin the three class of men and ask of them in turn which of their live is pleasantest each will be found prais hi own and depreci that of other the moneymak will contrast the vaniti of honour or of learn if thei bring no monei with the solid advantag of gold and silver true he said and the lover of honourwhat will be hi opinion will he not think that the pleasur of rich is vulgar while the pleasur of learn if it bring no distinct is all smoke and nonsens to him veri true and ar we to suppos i said that the philosoph set ani valu on other pleasur in comparison with the pleasur of know the truth and in that pursuit abid ever learn not so far inde from the heaven of pleasur doe he not call the other pleasur necessari under the idea that if there were no necess for them he would rather not have them there can be no doubt of that he repli sinc then the pleasur of each class and the life of each ar in disput and the question is not which life is more or less honour or better or wors but which is the more pleasant or painlesshow shall we know who speak truli i cannot myself tell he said well but what ought to be the criterion is ani better than experi and wisdom and reason there cannot be a better he said then i said reflect of the three individu which ha the greatest experi of all the pleasur which we enumer ha the lover of gain in learn the natur of essenti truth greater experi of the pleasur of knowledg than the philosoph ha of the pleasur of gain the philosoph he repli ha greatli the advantag for he ha of necess alwai known the tast of the other pleasur from hi childhood upward but the lover of gain in all hi experi ha not of necess tastedor i should rather sai even had he desir could hardli have tastedth sweet of learn and know truth then the lover of wisdom ha a great advantag over the lover of gain for he ha a doubl experi ye veri great again ha he greater experi of the pleasur of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasur of wisdom nai he said all three ar honour in proport as thei attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alik have their crowd of admir and as thei all receiv honour thei all have experi of the pleasur of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledg of true be is known to the philosoph onli hi experi then will enabl him to judg better than ani on far better and he is the onli on who ha wisdom as well as experi certainli further the veri faculti which is the instrument of judgment is not possess by the covet or ambiti man but onli by the philosoph what faculti reason with whom as we were sai the decis ought to rest ye and reason is peculiarli hi instrument certainli if wealth and gain were the criterion then the prais or blame of the lover of gain would sure be the most trustworthi assuredli or if honour or victori or courag in that case the judgment of the ambiti or pugnaci would be the truest clearli but sinc experi and wisdom and reason ar the judg the onli infer possibl he repli is that pleasur which ar approv by the lover of wisdom and reason ar the truest and so we arriv at the result that the pleasur of the intellig part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom thi is the rule principl ha the pleasantest life unquestion he said the wise man speak with author when he approv of hi own life and what doe the judg affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasur which is next clearli that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the moneymak last come the lover of gain veri true he said twice in success then ha the just man overthrown the unjust in thi conflict and now come the third trial which is dedic to olympian zeu the saviour a sage whisper in my ear that no pleasur except that of the wise is quit true and pureal other ar a shadow onli and sure thi will prove the greatest and most decis of fall ye the greatest but will you explain yourself i will work out the subject and you shall answer my question proce sai then is not pleasur oppos to pain true and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasur nor pain there is a state which is intermedi and a sort of repos of the soul about eitherthat is what you mean ye you rememb what peopl sai when thei ar sick what do thei sai that after all noth is pleasant than health but then thei never knew thi to be the greatest of pleasur until thei were ill ye i know he said and when person ar suffer from acut pain you must have heard them sai that there is noth pleasant than to get rid of their pain i have and there ar mani other case of suffer in which the mere rest and cessat of pain and not ani posit enjoy is extol by them as the greatest pleasur ye he said at the time thei ar pleas and well content to be at rest again when pleasur ceas that sort of rest or cessat will be pain doubtless he said then the intermedi state of rest will be pleasur and will also be pain so it would seem but can that which is neither becom both i should sai not and both pleasur and pain ar motion of the soul ar thei not ye but that which is neither wa just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them ye how then can we be right in suppos that the absenc of pain is pleasur or that the absenc of pleasur is pain imposs thi then is an appear onli and not a realiti that is to sai the rest is pleasur at the moment and in comparison of what is pain and pain in comparison of what is pleasant but all these represent when tri by the test of true pleasur ar not real but a sort of imposit that is the infer look at the other class of pleasur which have no anteced pain and you will no longer suppos as you perhap mai at present that pleasur is onli the cessat of pain or pain of pleasur what ar thei he said and where shall i find them there ar mani of them take as an exampl the pleasur of smell which ar veri great and have no anteced pain thei come in a moment and when thei depart leav no pain behind them most true he said let us not then be induc to believ that pure pleasur is the cessat of pain or pain of pleasur no still the more numer and violent pleasur which reach the soul through the bodi ar gener of thi sortthei ar relief of pain that is true and the anticip of futur pleasur and pain ar of a like natur ye shall i give you an illustr of them let me hear you would allow i said that there is in natur an upper and lower and middl region i should and if a person were to go from the lower to the middl region would he not imagin that he is go up and he who is stand in the middl and see whenc he ha come would imagin that he is alreadi in the upper region if he ha never seen the true upper world to be sure he said how can he think otherwis but if he were taken back again he would imagin and truli imagin that he wa descend no doubt all that would aris out of hi ignor of the true upper and middl and lower region ye then can you wonder that person who ar inexperienc in the truth as thei have wrong idea about mani other thing should also have wrong idea about pleasur and pain and the intermedi state so that when thei ar onli be drawn toward the pain thei feel pain and think the pain which thei experi to be real and in like manner when drawn awai from pain to the neutral or intermedi state thei firmli believ that thei have reach the goal of satieti and pleasur thei not know pleasur err in contrast pain with the absenc of pain which is like contrast black with grei instead of whitecan you wonder i sai at thi no inde i should be much more dispos to wonder at the opposit look at the matter thushung thirst and the like ar inanit of the bodili state ye and ignor and folli ar inanit of the soul true and food and wisdom ar the correspond satisfact of either certainli and is the satisfact deriv from that which ha less or from that which ha more exist the truer clearli from that which ha more what class of thing have a greater share of pure exist in your judgmentthos of which food and drink and condiment and all kind of susten ar exampl or the class which contain true opinion and knowledg and mind and all the differ kind of virtu put the question in thi waywhich ha a more pure beingthat which is concern with the invari the immort and the true and is of such a natur and is found in such natur or that which is concern with and found in the variabl and mortal and is itself variabl and mortal far purer he repli is the be of that which is concern with the invari and doe the essenc of the invari partak of knowledg in the same degre as of essenc ye of knowledg in the same degre and of truth in the same degre ye and convers that which ha less of truth will also have less of essenc necessarili then in gener those kind of thing which ar in the servic of the bodi have less of truth and essenc than those which ar in the servic of the soul far less and ha not the bodi itself less of truth and essenc than the soul ye what is fill with more real exist and actual ha a more real exist is more realli fill than that which is fill with less real exist and is less real of cours and if there be a pleasur in be fill with that which is accord to natur that which is more realli fill with more real be will more realli and truli enjoi true pleasur wherea that which particip in less real be will be less truli and sure satisfi and will particip in an illusori and less real pleasur unquestion those then who know not wisdom and virtu and ar alwai busi with gluttoni and sensual go down and up again as far as the mean and in thi region thei move at random throughout life but thei never pass into the true upper world thither thei neither look nor do thei ever find their wai neither ar thei truli fill with true be nor do thei tast of pure and abid pleasur like cattl with their ey alwai look down and their head stoop to the earth that is to the diningt thei fatten and feed and breed and in their excess love of these delight thei kick and butt at on anoth with horn and hoof which ar made of iron and thei kill on anoth by reason of their insati lust for thei fill themselv with that which is not substanti and the part of themselv which thei fill is also unsubstanti and incontin verili socrat said glaucon you describ the life of the mani like an oracl their pleasur ar mix with painshow can thei be otherwis for thei ar mere shadow and pictur of the true and ar colour by contrast which exagger both light and shade and so thei implant in the mind of fool insan desir of themselv and thei ar fought about as stesichoru sai that the greek fought about the shadow of helen at troi in ignor of the truth someth of that sort must inevit happen and must not the like happen with the spirit or passion element of the soul will not the passion man who carri hi passion into action be in the like case whether he is enviou and ambiti or violent and contenti or angri and discont if he be seek to attain honour and victori and the satisfact of hi anger without reason or sens ye he said the same will happen with the spirit element also then mai we not confid assert that the lover of monei and honour when thei seek their pleasur under the guidanc and in the compani of reason and knowledg and pursu after and win the pleasur which wisdom show them will also have the truest pleasur in the highest degre which is attain to them inasmuch as thei follow truth and thei will have the pleasur which ar natur to them if that which is best for each on is also most natur to him ye certainli the best is the most natur and when the whole soul follow the philosoph principl and there is no divis the sever part ar just and do each of them their own busi and enjoi sever the best and truest pleasur of which thei ar capabl exactli but when either of the two other principl prevail it fail in attain it own pleasur and compel the rest to pursu after a pleasur which is a shadow onli and which is not their own true and the greater the interv which separ them from philosophi and reason the more strang and illus will be the pleasur ye and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distanc from law and order clearli and the lust and tyrann desir ar as we saw at the greatest distanc ye and the royal and orderli desir ar nearest ye then the tyrant will live at the greatest distanc from true or natur pleasur and the king at the least certainli but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantli and the king most pleasantli inevit would you know the measur of the interv which separ them will you tell me there appear to be three pleasur on genuin and two spuriou now the transgress of the tyrant reach a point beyond the spuriou he ha run awai from the region of law and reason and taken up hi abod with certain slave pleasur which ar hi satellit and the measur of hi inferior can onli be express in a figur how do you mean i assum i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat wa in the middl ye and if there is truth in what ha preced he will be wed to an imag of pleasur which is thrice remov as to truth from the pleasur of the oligarch he will and the oligarch is third from the royal sinc we count as on royal and aristocrat ye he is third then the tyrant is remov from true pleasur by the space of a number which is three time three manifestli the shadow then of tyrann pleasur determin by the number of length will be a plane figur certainli and if you rais the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulti in see how vast is the interv by which the tyrant is part from the king ye the arithmetician will easili do the sum or if some person begin at the other end and measur the interv by which the king is part from the tyrant in truth of pleasur he will find him when the multipl is complet live time more pleasantli and the tyrant more painfulli by thi same interv what a wonder calcul and how enorm is the distanc which separ the just from the unjust in regard to pleasur and pain yet a true calcul i said and a number which nearli concern human life if human be ar concern with dai and night and month and year nearli equal the number of dai and night in the year ye he said human life is certainli concern with them then if the good and just man be thu superior in pleasur to the evil and unjust hi superior will be infinit greater in proprieti of life and in beauti and virtu immeasur greater well i said and now have arriv at thi stage of the argument we mai revert to the word which brought us hither wa not some on sai that injustic wa a gain to the perfectli unjust who wa reput to be just ye that wa said now then have determin the power and qualiti of justic and injustic let us have a littl convers with him what shall we sai to him let us make an imag of the soul that he mai have hi own word present befor hi ey of what sort an ideal imag of the soul like the composit creation of ancient mytholog such as the chimera or scylla or cerberu and there ar mani other in which two or more differ natur ar said to grow into on there ar said of have been such union then do you now model the form of a multitudin manyhead monster have a ring of head of all manner of beast tame and wild which he is abl to gener and metamorphos at will you suppos marvel power in the artist but as languag is more pliabl than wax or ani similar substanc let there be such a model as you propos suppos now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you sai and now join them and let the three grow into on that ha been accomplish next fashion the outsid of them into a singl imag as of a man so that he who is not abl to look within and see onli the outer hull mai believ the beast to be a singl human creatur i have done so he said and now to him who maintain that it is profit for the human creatur to be unjust and unprofit to be just let us repli that if he be right it is profit for thi creatur to feast the multitudin monster and strengthen the lion and the lionlik qualiti but to starv and weaken the man who is consequ liabl to be drag about at the merci of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiar or harmon them with on anotherh ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour on anoth certainli he said that is what the approv of injustic sai to him the support of justic make answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some wai or other the most complet masteri over the entir human creatur he should watch over the manyhead monster like a good husbandman foster and cultiv the gentl qualiti and prevent the wild on from grow he should be make the lionheart hi alli and in common care of them all should be unit the sever part with on anoth and with himself ye he said that is quit what the maintain of justic sai and so from everi point of view whether of pleasur honour or advantag the approv of justic is right and speak the truth and the disapprov is wrong and fals and ignor ye from everi point of view come now and let us gentli reason with the unjust who is not intention in error sweet sir we will sai to him what think you of thing esteem nobl and ignobl is not the nobl that which subject the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignobl that which subject the man to the beast he can hardli avoid sai yescan he now not if he ha ani regard for my opinion but if he agre so far we mai ask him to answer anoth question then how would a man profit if he receiv gold and silver on the condit that he wa to enslav the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagin that a man who sold hi son or daughter into slaveri for monei especi if he sold them into the hand of fierc and evil men would be the gainer howev larg might be the sum which he receiv and will ani on sai that he is not a miser caitiff who remorselessli sell hi own divin be to that which is most godless and detest eriphyl took the necklac as the price of her husband life but he is take a bribe in order to compass a wors ruin ye said glaucon far worsei will answer for him ha not the intemper been censur of old becaus in him the huge multiform monster is allow to be too much at larg clearli and men ar blame for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportion grow and gain strength ye and luxuri and soft ar blame becaus thei relax and weaken thi same creatur and make a coward of him veri true and is not a man reproach for flatteri and mean who subordin the spirit anim to the unruli monster and for the sake of monei of which he can never have enough habitu him in the dai of hi youth to be trampl in the mire and from be a lion to becom a monkei true he said and why ar mean employ and manual art a reproach onli becaus thei impli a natur weak of the higher principl the individu is unabl to control the creatur within him but ha to court them and hi great studi is how to flatter them such appear to be the reason and therefor be desir of place him under a rule like that of the best we sai that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divin rule not as thrasymachu suppos to the injuri of the servant but becaus everi on had better be rule by divin wisdom dwell within him or if thi be imposs then by an extern author in order that we mai be all as far as possibl under the same govern friend and equal true he said and thi is clearli seen to be the intent of the law which is the alli of the whole citi and is seen also in the author which we exercis over children and the refus to let them be free until we have establish in them a principl analog to the constitut of a state and by cultiv of thi higher element have set up in their heart a guardian and ruler like our own and when thi is done thei mai go their wai ye he said the purpos of the law is manifest from what point of view then and on what ground can we sai that a man is profit by injustic or intemper or other base which will make him a wors man even though he acquir monei or power by hi wicked from no point of view at all what shall he profit if hi injustic be undetect and unpunish he who is undetect onli get wors wherea he who is detect and punish ha the brutal part of hi natur silenc and human the gentler element in him is liber and hi whole soul is perfect and ennobl by the acquir of justic and temper and wisdom more than the bodi ever is by receiv gift of beauti strength and health in proport as the soul is more honour than the bodi certainli he said to thi nobler purpos the man of understand will devot the energi of hi life and in the first place he will honour studi which impress these qualiti on hi soul and will disregard other clearli he said in the next place he will regul hi bodili habit and train and so far will he be from yield to brutal and irrat pleasur that he will regard even health as quit a secondari matter hi first object will be not that he mai be fair or strong or well unless he is like therebi to gain temper but he will alwai desir so to attemp the bodi as to preserv the harmoni of the soul certainli he will if he ha true music in him and in the acquisit of wealth there is a principl of order and harmoni which he will also observ he will not allow himself to be dazzl by the foolish applaus of the world and heap up rich to hi own infinit harm certainli not he said he will look at the citi which is within him and take heed that no disord occur in it such as might aris either from superflu or from want and upon thi principl he will regul hi properti and gain or spend accord to hi mean veri true and for the same reason he will gladli accept and enjoi such honour as he deem like to make him a better man but those whether privat or public which ar like to disord hi life he will avoid then if that is hi motiv he will not be a statesman by the dog of egypt he will in the citi which is hi own he certainli will though in the land of hi birth perhap not unless he have a divin call i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the citi of which we ar the founder and which exist in idea onli for i do not believ that there is such an on anywher on earth in heaven i repli there is laid up a pattern of it methink which he who desir mai behold and behold mai set hi own hous in order but whether such an on exist or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that citi have noth to do with ani other i think so he said book x of the mani excel which i perceiv in the order of our state there is none which upon reflect pleas me better than the rule about poetri to what do you refer to the reject of imit poetri which certainli ought not to be receiv as i see far more clearli now that the part of the soul have been distinguish what do you mean speak in confid for i should not like to have my word repeat to the tragedian and the rest of the imit tribebut i do not mind sai to you that all poetic imit ar ruinou to the understand of the hearer and that the knowledg of their true natur is the onli antidot to them explain the purport of your remark well i will tell you although i have alwai from my earliest youth had an aw and love of homer which even now make the word falter on my lip for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charm tragic compani but a man is not to be reverenc more than the truth and therefor i will speak out veri good he said listen to me then or rather answer me put your question can you tell me what imit is for i realli do not know a like thing then that i should know why not for the duller ey mai often see a thing sooner than the keener veri true he said but in your presenc even if i had ani faint notion i could not muster courag to utter it will you enquir yourself well then shall we begin the enquiri in our usual manner whenev a number of individu have a common name we assum them to have also a correspond idea or formdo you understand me i do let us take ani common instanc there ar bed and tabl in the worldplenti of them ar there not ye but there ar onli two idea or form of themon the idea of a bed the other of a tabl true and the maker of either of them make a bed or he make a tabl for our us in accord with the ideathat is our wai of speak in thi and similar instancesbut no artific make the idea themselv how could he imposs and there is anoth artisti should like to know what you would sai of him who is he on who is the maker of all the work of all other workmen what an extraordinari man wait a littl and there will be more reason for your sai so for thi is he who is abl to make not onli vessel of everi kind but plant and anim himself and all other thingsth earth and heaven and the thing which ar in heaven or under the earth he make the god also he must be a wizard and no mistak oh you ar incredul ar you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in on sens there might be a maker of all these thing but in anoth not do you see that there is a wai in which you could make them all yourself what wai an easi wai enough or rather there ar mani wai in which the feat might be quickli and easili accomplish none quicker than that of turn a mirror round and roundyou would soon enough make the sun and the heaven and the earth and yourself and other anim and plant and all the other thing of which we were just now speak in the mirror ye he said but thei would be appear onli veri good i said you ar come to the point now and the painter too is as i conceiv just such anothera creator of appear is he not of cours but then i suppos you will sai that what he creat is untru and yet there is a sens in which the painter also creat a bed ye he said but not a real bed and what of the maker of the bed were you not sai that he too make not the idea which accord to our view is the essenc of the bed but onli a particular bed ye i did then if he doe not make that which exist he cannot make true exist but onli some semblanc of exist and if ani on were to sai that the work of the maker of the bed or of ani other workman ha real exist he could hardli be suppos to be speak the truth at ani rate he repli philosoph would sai that he wa not speak the truth no wonder then that hi work too is an indistinct express of truth no wonder suppos now that by the light of the exampl just offer we enquir who thi imit is if you pleas well then here ar three bed on exist in natur which is made by god as i think that we mai sayfor no on els can be the maker no there is anoth which is the work of the carpent ye and the work of the painter is a third ye bed then ar of three kind and there ar three artist who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter ye there ar three of them god whether from choic or from necess made on bed in natur and on onli two or more such ideal bed neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god why is that becaus even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and not the two other veri true he said god knew thi and he desir to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefor he creat a bed which is essenti and by natur on onli so we believ shall we then speak of him as the natur author or maker of the bed ye he repli inasmuch as by the natur process of creation he is the author of thi and of all other thing and what shall we sai of the carpenteri not he also the maker of the bed ye but would you call the painter a creator and maker certainli not yet if he is not the maker what is he in relat to the bed i think he said that we mai fairli design him as the imit of that which the other make good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from natur an imit certainli he said and the tragic poet is an imit and therefor like all other imit he is thrice remov from the king and from the truth that appear to be so then about the imit we ar agre and what about the painteri would like to know whether he mai be thought to imit that which origin exist in natur or onli the creation of artist the latter as thei ar or as thei appear you have still to determin thi what do you mean i mean that you mai look at a bed from differ point of view obliqu or directli or from ani other point of view and the bed will appear differ but there is no differ in realiti and the same of all thing ye he said the differ is onli appar now let me ask you anoth question which is the art of paint design to bean imit of thing as thei ar or as thei appearof appear or of realiti of appear then the imit i said is a long wai off the truth and can do all thing becaus he lightli touch on a small part of them and that part an imag for exampl a painter will paint a cobbler carpent or ani other artist though he know noth of their art and if he is a good artist he mai deceiv children or simpl person when he show them hi pictur of a carpent from a distanc and thei will fanci that thei ar look at a real carpent certainli and whenev ani on inform us that he ha found a man who know all the art and all thing els that anybodi know and everi singl thing with a higher degre of accuraci than ani other manwhoev tell us thi i think that we can onli imagin him to be a simpl creatur who is like to have been deceiv by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought allknow becaus he himself wa unabl to analys the natur of knowledg and ignor and imit most true and so when we hear person sai that the tragedian and homer who is at their head know all the art and all thing human virtu as well as vice and divin thing too for that the good poet cannot compos well unless he know hi subject and that he who ha not thi knowledg can never be a poet we ought to consid whether here also there mai not be a similar illus perhap thei mai have come across imit and been deceiv by them thei mai not have rememb when thei saw their work that these were but imit thrice remov from the truth and could easili be made without ani knowledg of the truth becaus thei ar appear onli and not realiti or after all thei mai be in the right and poet do realli know the thing about which thei seem to the mani to speak so well the question he said should by all mean be consid now do you suppos that if a person were abl to make the origin as well as the imag he would serious devot himself to the imagemak branch would he allow imit to be the rule principl of hi life as if he had noth higher in him i should sai not the real artist who knew what he wa imit would be interest in realiti and not in imit and would desir to leav as memori of himself work mani and fair and instead of be the author of encomium he would prefer to be the theme of them ye he said that would be to him a sourc of much greater honour and profit then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicin or ani of the art to which hi poem onli incident refer we ar not go to ask him or ani other poet whether he ha cure patient like asclepiu or left behind him a school of medicin such as the asclepiad were or whether he onli talk about medicin and other art at secondhand but we have a right to know respect militari tactic polit educ which ar the chiefest and noblest subject of hi poem and we mai fairli ask him about them friend homer then we sai to him if you ar onli in the second remov from truth in what you sai of virtu and not in the thirdnot an imag maker or imitatorand if you ar abl to discern what pursuit make men better or wors in privat or public life tell us what state wa ever better govern by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgu and mani other citi great and small have been similarli benefit by other but who sai that you have been a good legisl to them and have done them ani good itali and sicili boast of charonda and there is solon who is renown among us but what citi ha anyth to sai about you is there ani citi which he might name i think not said glaucon not even the homerid themselv pretend that he wa a legisl well but is there ani war on record which wa carri on successfulli by him or aid by hi counsel when he wa aliv there is not or is there ani invent of hi applic to the art or to human life such as thale the milesian or anacharsi the scythian and other ingeni men have conceiv which is attribut to him there is absolut noth of the kind but if homer never did ani public servic wa he privat a guid or teacher of ani had he in hi lifetim friend who love to associ with him and who hand down to poster an homer wai of life such as wa establish by pythagora who wa so greatli belov for hi wisdom and whose follow ar to thi dai quit celebr for the order which wa name after him noth of the kind is record of him for sure socrat creophylu the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name alwai make us laugh might be more justli ridicul for hi stupid if as is said homer wa greatli neglect by him and other in hi own dai when he wa aliv ye i repli that is the tradit but can you imagin glaucon that if homer had realli been abl to educ and improv mankindif he had possess knowledg and not been a mere imitatorcan you imagin i sai that he would not have had mani follow and been honour and love by them protagora of abdera and prodicu of ceo and a host of other have onli to whisper to their contemporari you will never be abl to manag either your own hous or your own state until you appoint us to be your minist of educationand thi ingeni devic of their ha such an effect in make men love them that their companion all but carri them about on their shoulder and is it conceiv that the contemporari of homer or again of hesiod would have allow either of them to go about as rhapsodist if thei had realli been abl to make mankind virtuou would thei not have been as unwil to part with them as with gold and have compel them to stai at home with them or if the master would not stai then the discipl would have follow him about everywher until thei had got educ enough ye socrat that i think is quit true then must we not infer that all these poetic individu begin with homer ar onli imit thei copi imag of virtu and the like but the truth thei never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have alreadi observ will make a like of a cobbler though he understand noth of cobbl and hi pictur is good enough for those who know no more than he doe and judg onli by colour and figur quit so in like manner the poet with hi word and phrase mai be said to lai on the colour of the sever art himself understand their natur onli enough to imit them and other peopl who ar as ignor as he is and judg onli from hi word imagin that if he speak of cobbl or of militari tactic or of anyth els in metr and harmoni and rhythm he speak veri wellsuch is the sweet influenc which melodi and rhythm by natur have and i think that you must have observ again and again what a poor appear the tale of poet make when strip of the colour which music put upon them and recit in simpl prose ye he said thei ar like face which were never realli beauti but onli bloom and now the bloom of youth ha pass awai from them exactli here is anoth point the imit or maker of the imag know noth of true exist he know appear onli am i not right ye then let us have a clear understand and not be satisfi with half an explan proce of the painter we sai that he will paint rein and he will paint a bit ye and the worker in leather and brass will make them certainli but doe the painter know the right form of the bit and rein nai hardli even the worker in brass and leather who make them onli the horseman who know how to us themh know their right form most true and mai we not sai the same of all thing what that there ar three art which ar concern with all thing on which us anoth which make a third which imit them ye and the excel or beauti or truth of everi structur anim or inanim and of everi action of man is rel to the us for which natur or the artist ha intend them true then the user of them must have the greatest experi of them and he must indic to the maker the good or bad qualiti which develop themselv in us for exampl the fluteplay will tell the flutemak which of hi flute is satisfactori to the perform he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to hi instruct of cours the on know and therefor speak with author about the good and bad of flute while the other confid in him will do what he is told by him true the instrument is the same but about the excel or bad of it the maker will onli attain to a correct belief and thi he will gain from him who know by talk to him and be compel to hear what he ha to sai wherea the user will have knowledg true but will the imit have either will he know from us whether or no hi draw is correct or beauti or will he have right opinion from be compel to associ with anoth who know and give him instruct about what he should draw neither then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledg about the good or bad of hi imit i suppos not the imit artist will be in a brilliant state of intellig about hi own creation nai veri much the revers and still he will go on imit without know what make a thing good or bad and mai be expect therefor to imit onli that which appear to be good to the ignor multitud just so thu far then we ar pretti well agre that the imit ha no knowledg worth mention of what he imit imit is onli a kind of plai or sport and the tragic poet whether thei write in iambic or in heroic vers ar imit in the highest degre veri true and now tell me i conjur you ha not imit been shown by us to be concern with that which is thrice remov from the truth certainli and what is the faculti in man to which imit is address what do you mean i will explain the bodi which is larg when seen near appear small when seen at a distanc true and the same object appear straight when look at out of the water and crook when in the water and the concav becom convex ow to the illus about colour to which the sight is liabl thu everi sort of confus is reveal within us and thi is that weak of the human mind on which the art of conjur and of deceiv by light and shadow and other ingeni devic impos have an effect upon us like magic true and the art of measur and number and weigh come to the rescu of the human understandingther is the beauti of themand the appar greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the masteri over us but give wai befor calcul and measur and weight most true and thi sure must be the work of the calcul and ration principl in the soul to be sure and when thi principl measur and certifi that some thing ar equal or that some ar greater or less than other there occur an appar contradict true but were we not sai that such a contradict is impossibleth same faculti cannot have contrari opinion at the same time about the same thing veri true then that part of the soul which ha an opinion contrari to measur is not the same with that which ha an opinion in accord with measur true and the better part of the soul is like to be that which trust to measur and calcul certainli and that which is oppos to them is on of the inferior principl of the soul no doubt thi wa the conclus at which i wa seek to arriv when i said that paint or draw and imit in gener when do their own proper work ar far remov from truth and the companion and friend and associ of a principl within us which is equal remov from reason and that thei have no true or healthi aim exactli the imit art is an inferior who marri an inferior and ha inferior offspr veri true and is thi confin to the sight onli or doe it extend to the hear also relat in fact to what we term poetri probabl the same would be true of poetri do not reli i said on a probabl deriv from the analog of paint but let us examin further and see whether the faculti with which poetic imit is concern is good or bad by all mean we mai state the question thusimit imit the action of men whether voluntari or involuntari on which as thei imagin a good or bad result ha ensu and thei rejoic or sorrow accordingli is there anyth more no there is noth els but in all thi varieti of circumst is the man at uniti with himselfor rather as in the instanc of sight there wa confus and opposit in hi opinion about the same thing so here also is there not strife and inconsist in hi life though i need hardli rais the question again for i rememb that all thi ha been alreadi admit and the soul ha been acknowledg by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar opposit occur at the same moment and we were right he said ye i said thu far we were right but there wa an omiss which must now be suppli what wa the omiss were we not sai that a good man who ha the misfortun to lose hi son or anyth els which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanim than anoth ye but will he have no sorrow or shall we sai that although he cannot help sorrow he will moder hi sorrow the latter he said is the truer statement tell me will he be more like to struggl and hold out against hi sorrow when he is seen by hi equal or when he is alon it will make a great differ whether he is seen or not when he is by himself he will not mind sai or do mani thing which he would be asham of ani on hear or see him do true there is a principl of law and reason in him which bid him resist as well as a feel of hi misfortun which is forc him to indulg hi sorrow true but when a man is drawn in two opposit direct to and from the same object thi as we affirm necessarili impli two distinct principl in him certainli on of them is readi to follow the guidanc of the law how do you mean the law would sai that to be patient under suffer is best and that we should not give wai to impati as there is no know whether such thing ar good or evil and noth is gain by impati also becaus no human thing is of seriou import and grief stand in the wai of that which at the moment is most requir what is most requir he ask that we should take counsel about what ha happen and when the dice have been thrown order our affair in the wai which reason deem best not like children who have had a fall keep hold of the part struck and wast time in set up a howl but alwai accustom the soul forthwith to appli a remedi rais up that which is sickli and fallen banish the cry of sorrow by the heal art ye he said that is the true wai of meet the attack of fortun ye i said and the higher principl is readi to follow thi suggest of reason clearli and the other principl which inclin us to recollect of our troubl and to lament and can never have enough of them we mai call irrat useless and cowardli inde we mai and doe not the latteri mean the rebelli principlefurnish a great varieti of materi for imit wherea the wise and calm tempera be alwai nearli equabl is not easi to imit or to appreci when imit especi at a public festiv when a promiscu crowd is assembl in a theatr for the feel repres is on to which thei ar stranger certainli then the imit poet who aim at be popular is not by natur made nor is hi art intend to pleas or to affect the ration principl in the soul but he will prefer the passion and fit temper which is easili imit clearli and now we mai fairli take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two wai first inasmuch as hi creation have an inferior degre of truthin thi i sai he is like him and he is also like him in be concern with an inferior part of the soul and therefor we shall be right in refus to admit him into a wellord state becaus he awaken and nourish and strengthen the feel and impair the reason as in a citi when the evil ar permit to have author and the good ar put out of the wai so in the soul of man as we maintain the imit poet implant an evil constitut for he indulg the irrat natur which ha no discern of greater and less but think the same thing at on time great and at anoth smallh is a manufactur of imag and is veri far remov from the truth exactli but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusationth power which poetri ha of harm even the good and there ar veri few who ar not harm is sure an aw thing ye certainli if the effect is what you sai hear and judg the best of us as i conceiv when we listen to a passag of homer or on of the tragedian in which he repres some piti hero who is drawl out hi sorrow in a long orat or weep and smite hi breastth best of us you know delight in give wai to sympathi and ar in raptur at the excel of the poet who stir our feel most ye of cours i know but when ani sorrow of our own happen to us then you mai observ that we pride ourselv on the opposit qualityw would fain be quiet and patient thi is the manli part and the other which delight us in the recit is now deem to be the part of a woman veri true he said now can we be right in prais and admir anoth who is do that which ani on of us would abomin and be asham of in hi own person no he said that is certainli not reason nai i said quit reason from on point of view what point of view if you consid i said that when in misfortun we feel a natur hunger and desir to reliev our sorrow by weep and lament and that thi feel which is kept under control in our own calam is satisfi and delight by the poetsth better natur in each of us not have been suffici train by reason or habit allow the sympathet element to break loos becaus the sorrow is anoth and the spectat fanci that there can be no disgrac to himself in prais and piti ani on who come tell him what a good man he is and make a fuss about hi troubl he think that the pleasur is a gain and why should he be supercili and lose thi and the poem too few person ever reflect as i should imagin that from the evil of other men someth of evil is commun to themselv and so the feel of sorrow which ha gather strength at the sight of the misfortun of other is with difficulti repress in our own how veri true and doe not the same hold also of the ridicul there ar jest which you would be asham to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or inde in privat when you hear them you ar greatli amus by them and ar not at all disgust at their unseemlinessth case of piti is repeatedther is a principl in human natur which is dispos to rais a laugh and thi which you onc restrain by reason becaus you were afraid of be thought a buffoon is now let out again and have stimul the risibl faculti at the theatr you ar betrai unconsci to yourself into plai the comic poet at home quit true he said and the same mai be said of lust and anger and all the other affect of desir and pain and pleasur which ar held to be insepar from everi actionin all of them poetri feed and water the passion instead of dry them up she let them rule although thei ought to be control if mankind ar ever to increas in happi and virtu i cannot deni it therefor glaucon i said whenev you meet with ani of the eulogist of homer declar that he ha been the educ of hella and that he is profit for educ and for the order of human thing and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regul your whole life accord to him we mai love and honour those who sai these thingsthei ar excel peopl as far as their light extend and we ar readi to acknowledg that homer is the greatest of poet and first of tragedi writer but we must remain firm in our convict that hymn to the god and prais of famou men ar the onli poetri which ought to be admit into our state for if you go beyond thi and allow the honei muse to enter either in epic or lyric vers not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deem best but pleasur and pain will be the ruler in our state that is most true he said and now sinc we have revert to the subject of poetri let thi our defenc serv to show the reason of our former judgment in send awai out of our state an art have the tendenc which we have describ for reason constrain us but that she mai not imput to us ani harsh or want of polit let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophi and poetri of which there ar mani proof such as the sai of the yelp hound howl at her lord or of on mighti in the vain talk of fool and the mob of sage circumv zeu and the subtl thinker who ar beggar after all and there ar innumer other sign of ancient enmiti between them notwithstand thi let us assur our sweet friend and the sister art of imit that if she will onli prove her titl to exist in a wellord state we shall be delight to receiv herw ar veri consciou of her charm but we mai not on that account betrai the truth i dare sai glaucon that you ar as much charm by her as i am especi when she appear in homer ye inde i am greatli charm shall i propos then that she be allow to return from exil but upon thi condit onlythat she make a defenc of herself in lyric or some other metr certainli and we mai further grant to those of her defend who ar lover of poetri and yet not poet the permiss to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not onli that she is pleasant but also us to state and to human life and we will listen in a kindli spirit for if thi can be prove we shall sure be the gainersi mean if there is a us in poetri as well as a delight certainli he said we shall be the gainer if her defenc fail then my dear friend like other person who ar enamour of someth but put a restraint upon themselv when thei think their desir ar oppos to their interest so too must we after the manner of lover give her up though not without a struggl we too ar inspir by that love of poetri which the educ of nobl state ha implant in us and therefor we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unabl to make good her defenc thi argument of our shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselv while we listen to her strain that we mai not fall awai into the childish love of her which captiv the mani at all event we ar well awar that poetri be such as we have describ is not to be regard serious as attain to the truth and he who listen to her fear for the safeti of the citi which is within him should be on hi guard against her seduct and make our word hi law ye he said i quit agre with you ye i said my dear glaucon for great is the issu at stake greater than appear whether a man is to be good or bad and what will ani on be profit if under the influenc of honour or monei or power ay or under the excit of poetri he neglect justic and virtu ye he said i have been convinc by the argument as i believ that ani on els would have been and yet no mention ha been made of the greatest prize and reward which await virtu what ar there ani greater still if there ar thei must be of an inconceiv great why i said what wa ever great in a short time the whole period of three score year and ten is sure but a littl thing in comparison with etern sai rather noth he repli and should an immort be serious think of thi littl space rather than of the whole of the whole certainli but why do you ask ar you not awar i said that the soul of man is immort and imperish he look at me in astonish and said no by heaven and ar you realli prepar to maintain thi ye i said i ought to be and you toother is no difficulti in prove it i see a great difficulti but i should like to hear you state thi argument of which you make so light listen then i am attend there is a thing which you call good and anoth which you call evil ye he repli would you agre with me in think that the corrupt and destroi element is the evil and the save and improv element the good ye and you admit that everi thing ha a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the ey and diseas of the whole bodi as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everyth or in almost everyth there is an inher evil and diseas ye he said and anyth which is infect by ani of these evil is made evil and at last wholli dissolv and di true the vice and evil which is inher in each is the destruct of each and if thi doe not destroi them there is noth els that will for good certainli will not destroi them nor again that which is neither good nor evil certainli not if then we find ani natur which have thi inher corrupt cannot be dissolv or destroi we mai be certain that of such a natur there is no destruct that mai be assum well i said and is there no evil which corrupt the soul ye he said there ar all the evil which we were just now pass in review unright intemper cowardic ignor but doe ani of these dissolv or destroi herand here do not let us fall into the error of suppos that the unjust and foolish man when he is detect perish through hi own injustic which is an evil of the soul take the analog of the bodi the evil of the bodi is a diseas which wast and reduc and annihil the bodi and all the thing of which we were just now speak come to annihil through their own corrupt attach to them and inher in them and so destroi them is not thi true ye consid the soul in like manner doe the injustic or other evil which exist in the soul wast and consum her do thei by attach to the soul and inher in her at last bring her to death and so separ her from the bodi certainli not and yet i said it is unreason to suppos that anyth can perish from without through affect of extern evil which could not be destroi from within by a corrupt of it own it is he repli consid i said glaucon that even the bad of food whether stale decomposit or ani other bad qualiti when confin to the actual food is not suppos to destroi the bodi although if the bad of food commun corrupt to the bodi then we should sai that the bodi ha been destroi by a corrupt of itself which is diseas brought on by thi but that the bodi be on thing can be destroi by the bad of food which is anoth and which doe not engend ani natur infectionthi we shall absolut deni veri true and on the same principl unless some bodili evil can produc an evil of the soul we must not suppos that the soul which is on thing can be dissolv by ani mere extern evil which belong to anoth ye he said there is reason in that either then let us refut thi conclus or while it remain unrefut let us never sai that fever or ani other diseas or the knife put to the throat or even the cut up of the whole bodi into the minutest piec can destroi the soul until she herself is prove to becom more unholi or unright in consequ of these thing be done to the bodi but that the soul or anyth els if not destroi by an intern evil can be destroi by an extern on is not to be affirm by ani man and sure he repli no on will ever prove that the soul of men becom more unjust in consequ of death but if some on who would rather not admit the immort of the soul boldli deni thi and sai that the dy do realli becom more evil and unright then if the speaker is right i suppos that injustic like diseas must be assum to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take thi disord die by the natur inher power of destruct which evil ha and which kill them sooner or later but in quit anoth wai from that in which at present the wick receiv death at the hand of other as the penalti of their deed nai he said in that case injustic if fatal to the unjust will not be so veri terribl to him for he will be deliv from evil but i rather suspect the opposit to be the truth and that injustic which if it have the power will murder other keep the murder aliveay and well awak too so far remov is her dwellingplac from be a hous of death true i said if the inher natur vice or evil of the soul is unabl to kill or destroi her hardli will that which is appoint to be the destruct of some other bodi destroi a soul or anyth els except that of which it wa appoint to be the destruct ye that can hardli be but the soul which cannot be destroi by an evil whether inher or extern must exist for ever and if exist for ever must be immort certainli that is the conclus i said and if a true conclus then the soul must alwai be the same for if none be destroi thei will not diminish in number neither will thei increas for the increas of the immort natur must come from someth mortal and all thing would thu end in immort veri true but thi we cannot believereason will not allow usani more than we can believ the soul in her truest natur to be full of varieti and differ and dissimilar what do you mean he said the soul i said be as is now proven immort must be the fairest of composit and cannot be compound of mani element certainli not her immort is demonstr by the previou argument and there ar mani other proof but to see her as she realli is not as we now behold her mar by communion with the bodi and other miseri you must contempl her with the ey of reason in her origin puriti and then her beauti will be reveal and justic and injustic and all the thing which we have describ will be manifest more clearli thu far we have spoken the truth concern her as she appear at present but we must rememb also that we have seen her onli in a condit which mai be compar to that of the seagod glaucu whose origin imag can hardli be discern becaus hi natur member ar broken off and crush and damag by the wave in all sort of wai and incrust have grown over them of seawe and shell and stone so that he is more like some monster than he is to hi own natur form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condit disfigur by ten thousand ill but not there glaucon not there must we look where then at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affect and what societi and convers she seek in virtu of her near kindr with the immort and etern and divin also how differ she would becom if wholli follow thi superior principl and born by a divin impuls out of the ocean in which she now is and disengag from the stone and shell and thing of earth and rock which in wild varieti spring up around her becaus she feed upon earth and is overgrown by the good thing of thi life as thei ar term then you would see her as she is and know whether she have on shape onli or mani or what her natur is of her affect and of the form which she take in thi present life i think that we have now said enough true he repli and thu i said we have fulfil the condit of the argument we have not introduc the reward and glori of justic which as you were sai ar to be found in homer and hesiod but justic in her own natur ha been shown to be best for the soul in her own natur let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyge or not and even if in addit to the ring of gyge he put on the helmet of hade veri true and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumer how mani and how great ar the reward which justic and the other virtu procur to the soul from god and men both in life and after death certainli not he said will you repai me then what you borrow in the argument what did i borrow the assumpt that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibl escap the ey of god and men still thi admiss ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justic might be weigh against pure injustic do you rememb i should be much to blame if i had forgotten then as the caus is decid i demand on behalf of justic that the estim in which she is held by god and men and which we acknowledg to be her due should now be restor to her by us sinc she ha been shown to confer realiti and not to deceiv those who truli possess her let what ha been taken from her be given back that so she mai win that palm of appear which is her also and which she give to her own the demand he said is just in the first place i saidand thi is the first thing which you will have to give backth natur both of the just and unjust is truli known to the god grant and if thei ar both known to them on must be the friend and the other the enemi of the god as we admit from the begin true and the friend of the god mai be suppos to receiv from them all thing at their best except onli such evil as is the necessari consequ of former sin certainli then thi must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverti or sick or ani other seem misfortun all thing will in the end work togeth for good to him in life and death for the god have a care of ani on whose desir is to becom just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divin like by the pursuit of virtu ye he said if he is like god he will sure not be neglect by him and of the unjust mai not the opposit be suppos certainli such then ar the palm of victori which the god give the just that is my convict and what do thei receiv of men look at thing as thei realli ar and you will see that the clever unjust ar in the case of runner who run well from the startingplac to the goal but not back again from the goal thei go off at a great pace but in the end onli look foolish slink awai with their ear draggl on their shoulder and without a crown but the true runner come to the finish and receiv the prize and is crown and thi is the wai with the just he who endur to the end of everi action and occas of hi entir life ha a good report and carri off the prize which men have to bestow true and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the bless which you were attribut to the fortun unjust i shall sai of them what you were sai of the other that as thei grow older thei becom ruler in their own citi if thei care to be thei marri whom thei like and give in marriag to whom thei will all that you said of the other i now sai of these and on the other hand of the unjust i sai that the greater number even though thei escap in their youth ar found out at last and look foolish at the end of their cours and when thei come to be old and miser ar flout alik by stranger and citizen thei ar beaten and then come those thing unfit for ear polit as you truli term them thei will be rack and have their ey burn out as you were sai and you mai suppos that i have repeat the remaind of your tale of horror but will you let me assum without recit them that these thing ar true certainli he said what you sai is true these then ar the prize and reward and gift which ar bestow upon the just by god and men in thi present life in addit to the other good thing which justic of herself provid ye he said and thei ar fair and last and yet i said all these ar as noth either in number or great in comparison with those other recompens which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have receiv from us a full payment of the debt which the argument ow to them speak he said there ar few thing which i would more gladli hear well i said i will tell you a tale not on of the tale which odysseu tell to the hero alcin yet thi too is a tale of a hero er the son of armeniu a pamphylian by birth he wa slain in battl and ten dai afterward when the bodi of the dead were taken up alreadi in a state of corrupt hi bodi wa found unaffect by decai and carri awai home to be buri and on the twelfth dai as he wa ly on the funer pile he return to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when hi soul left the bodi he went on a journei with a great compani and that thei came to a mysteri place at which there were two open in the earth thei were near togeth and over against them were two other open in the heaven abov in the intermedi space there were judg seat who command the just after thei had given judgment on them and had bound their sentenc in front of them to ascend by the heavenli wai on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower wai on the left hand these also bore the symbol of their deed but fasten on their back he drew near and thei told him that he wa to be the messeng who would carri the report of the other world to men and thei bade him hear and see all that wa to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on on side the soul depart at either open of heaven and earth when sentenc had been given on them and at the two other open other soul some ascend out of the earth dusti and worn with travel some descend out of heaven clean and bright and arriv ever and anon thei seem to have come from a long journei and thei went forth with glad into the meadow where thei encamp as at a festiv and those who knew on anoth embrac and convers the soul which came from earth curious enquir about the thing abov and the soul which came from heaven about the thing beneath and thei told on anoth of what had happen by the wai those from below weep and sorrow at the remembr of the thing which thei had endur and seen in their journei beneath the earth now the journei last a thousand year while those from abov were describ heavenli delight and vision of inconceiv beauti the stori glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum wa thish said that for everi wrong which thei had done to ani on thei suffer tenfold or onc in a hundr yearssuch be reckon to be the length of man life and the penalti be thu paid ten time in a thousand year if for exampl there were ani who had been the caus of mani death or had betrai or enslav citi or armi or been guilti of ani other evil behaviour for each and all of their offenc thei receiv punish ten time over and the reward of benefic and justic and holi were in the same proport i need hardli repeat what he said concern young children dy almost as soon as thei were born of pieti and impieti to god and parent and of murder there were retribut other and greater far which he describ he mention that he wa present when on of the spirit ask anoth where is ardiaeu the great now thi ardiaeu live a thousand year befor the time of er he had been the tyrant of some citi of pamphylia and had murder hi ag father and hi elder brother and wa said to have commit mani other abomin crime the answer of the other spirit wa he come not hither and will never come and thi said he wa on of the dread sight which we ourselv wit we were at the mouth of the cavern and have complet all our experi were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeu appear and sever other most of whom were tyrant and there were also besid the tyrant privat individu who had been great crimin thei were just as thei fanci about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admit them gave a roar whenev ani of these incur sinner or some on who had not been suffici punish tri to ascend and then wild men of fieri aspect who were stand by and heard the sound seiz and carri them off and ardiaeu and other thei bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flai them with scourg and drag them along the road at the side card them on thorn like wool and declar to the passersbi what were their crime and that thei were be taken awai to be cast into hell and of all the mani terror which thei had endur he said that there wa none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest thei should hear the voic and when there wa silenc on by on thei ascend with exceed joi these said er were the penalti and retribut and there were bless as great now when the spirit which were in the meadow had tarri seven dai on the eighth thei were oblig to proce on their journei and on the fourth dai after he said that thei came to a place where thei could see from abov a line of light straight as a column extend right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembl the rainbow onli brighter and purer anoth dai journei brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light thei saw the end of the chain of heaven let down from abov for thi light is the belt of heaven and hold togeth the circl of the univers like the undergird of a trirem from these end is extend the spindl of necess on which all the revolut turn the shaft and hook of thi spindl ar made of steel and the whorl is made partli of steel and also partli of other materi now the whorl is in form like the whorl us on earth and the descript of it impli that there is on larg hollow whorl which is quit scoop out and into thi is fit anoth lesser on and anoth and anoth and four other make eight in all like vessel which fit into on anoth the whorl show their edg on the upper side and on their lower side all togeth form on continu whorl thi is pierc by the spindl which is driven home through the centr of the eighth the first and outermost whorl ha the rim broadest and the seven inner whorl ar narrow in the follow proportionsth sixth is next

slowli in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swift ar the seventh sixth and fifth which move togeth third in swift appear to move accord to the law of thi revers motion the fourth the third appear fourth and the second fifth the spindl turn on the knee of necess and on the upper surfac of each circl is a siren who goe round with them hymn a singl tone or note the eight togeth form on harmoni and round about at equal interv there is anoth band three in number each sit upon her throne these ar the fate daughter of necess who ar cloth in white robe and have chaplet upon their head lachesi and clotho and atropo who accompani with their voic the harmoni of the sirenslachesi sing of the past clotho of the present atropo of the futur clotho from time to time assist with a touch of her right hand the revolut of the outer circl of the whorl or spindl and atropo with her left hand touch and guid the inner on and lachesi lai hold of either in turn first with on hand and then with the other when er and the spirit arriv their duti wa to go at onc to lachesi but first of all there came a prophet who arrang them in order then he took from the knee of lachesi lot and sampl of live and have mount a high pulpit spoke as follow hear the word of lachesi the daughter of necess mortal soul behold a new cycl of life and mortal your geniu will not be allot to you but you will choos your geniu and let him who draw the first lot have the first choic and the life which he choos shall be hi destini virtu is free and as a man honour or dishonour her he will have more or less of her the respons is with the choosergod is justifi when the interpret had thu spoken he scatter lot indiffer among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he wa not allow and each as he took hi lot perceiv the number which he had obtain then the interpret place on the ground befor them the sampl of live and there were mani more live than the soul present and thei were of all sort there were live of everi anim and of man in everi condit and there were tyranni among them some last out the tyrant life other which broke off in the middl and came to an end in poverti and exil and beggari and there were live of famou men some who were famou for their form and beauti as well as for their strength and success in game or again for their birth and the qualiti of their ancestor and some who were the revers of famou for the opposit qualiti and of women likewis there wa not howev ani definit charact in them becaus the soul when choos a new life must of necess becom differ but there wa everi other qualiti and the all mingl with on anoth and also with element of wealth and poverti and diseas and health and there were mean state also and here my dear glaucon is the suprem peril of our human state and therefor the utmost care should be taken let each on of us leav everi other kind of knowledg and seek and follow on thing onli if peradventur he mai be abl to learn and mai find some on who will make him abl to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choos alwai and everywher the better life as he ha opportun he should consid the bear of all these thing which have been mention sever and collect upon virtu he should know what the effect of beauti is when combin with poverti or wealth in a particular soul and what ar the good and evil consequ of nobl and humbl birth of privat and public station of strength and weak of clever and dull and of all the natur and acquir gift of the soul and the oper of them when conjoin he will then look at the natur of the soul and from the consider of all these qualiti he will be abl to determin which is the better and which is the wors and so he will choos give the name of evil to the life which will make hi soul more unjust and good to the life which will make hi soul more just all els he will disregard for we have seen and know that thi is the best choic both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantin faith in truth and right that there too he mai be undazzl by the desir of wealth or the other allur of evil lest come upon tyranni and similar villaini he do irremedi wrong to other and suffer yet wors himself but let him know how to choos the mean and avoid the extrem on either side as far as possibl not onli in thi life but in all that which is to come for thi is the wai of happi and accord to the report of the messeng from the other world thi wa what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he choos wise and will live dilig there is appoint a happi and not undesir exist let not him who choos first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choic came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranni hi mind have been darken by folli and sensual he had not thought out the whole matter befor he chose and did not at first sight perceiv that he wa fate among other evil to devour hi own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what wa in the lot he began to beat hi breast and lament over hi choic forget the proclam of the prophet for instead of throw the blame of hi misfortun on himself he accus chanc and the god and everyth rather than himself now he wa on of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a wellord state but hi virtu wa a matter of habit onli and he had no philosophi and it wa true of other who were similarli overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefor thei had never been school by trial wherea the pilgrim who came from earth have themselv suffer and seen other suffer were not in a hurri to choos and ow to thi inexperi of their and also becaus the lot wa a chanc mani of the soul exchang a good destini for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had alwai on hi arriv in thi world dedic himself from the first to sound philosophi and had been moder fortun in the number of the lot he might as the messeng report be happi here and also hi journei to anoth life and return to thi instead of be rough and underground would be smooth and heavenli most curiou he said wa the spectaclesad and laughabl and strang for the choic of the soul wa in most case base on their experi of a previou life there he saw the soul which had onc been orpheu choos the life of a swan out of enmiti to the race of women hate to be born of a woman becaus thei had been hi murder he beheld also the soul of thamyra choos the life of a nightingal bird on the other hand like the swan and other musician want to be men the soul which obtain the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and thi wa the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man rememb the injustic which wa done him in the judgment about the arm the next wa agamemnon who took the life of an eagl becaus like ajax he hate human natur by reason of hi suffer about the middl came the lot of atalanta she see the great fame of an athlet wa unabl to resist the temptat and after her there follow the soul of epeu the son of panopeu pass into the natur of a woman cun in the art and far awai among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersit wa put on the form of a monkei there came also the soul of odysseu have yet to make a choic and hi lot happen to be the last of them all now the recollect of former toil had disench him of ambit and he went about for a consider time in search of the life of a privat man who had no care he had some difficulti in find thi which wa ly about and had been neglect by everybodi els and when he saw it he said that he would have done the same had hi lot been first instead of last and that he wa delight to have it and not onli did men pass into anim but i must also mention that there were anim tame and wild who chang into on anoth and into correspond human naturesth good into the gentl and the evil into the savag in all sort of combin all the soul had now chosen their live and thei went in the order of their choic to lachesi who sent with them the geniu whom thei had sever chosen to be the guardian of their live and the fulfil of the choic thi geniu led the soul first to clotho and drew them within the revolut of the spindl impel by her hand thu ratifi the destini of each and then when thei were fasten to thi carri them to atropo who spun the thread and made them irrevers whenc without turn round thei pass beneath the throne of necess and when thei had all pass thei march on in a scorch heat to the plain of forget which wa a barren wast destitut of tree and verdur and then toward even thei encamp by the river of unmind whose water no vessel can hold of thi thei were all oblig to drink a certain quantiti and those who were not save by wisdom drank more than wa necessari and each on as he drank forgot all thing now after thei had gone to rest about the middl of the night there wa a thunderstorm and earthquak and then in an instant thei were driven upward in all manner of wai to their birth like star shoot he himself wa hinder from drink the water but in what manner or by what mean he return to the bodi he could not sai onli in the morn awak suddenli he found himself ly on the pyre and thu glaucon the tale ha been save and ha not perish and will save us if we ar obedi to the word spoken and we shall pass safe over the river of forget and our soul will not be defil wherefor my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenli wai and follow after justic and virtu alwai consid that the soul is immort and abl to endur everi sort of good and everi sort of evil thu shall we live dear to on anoth and to the god both while remain here and when like conqueror in the game who go round to gather gift we receiv our
