ignor the problem of the valu of truth present itself befor usor wa it we who present ourselv befor the problem which of us is the oedipu here which the sphinx it would seem to be a rendezv of question and note of interrog and could it be believ that it at last seem to us as if the problem had never been propound befor as if we were the first to discern it get a sight of it and risk rais it for there is risk in rais it perhap there is no greater risk how could anyth origin out of it opposit for exampl truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to decept or the gener deed out

doubt firstli whether antithes exist at all and secondli whether the popular valuat and antithes of valu upon which metaphysician have set their seal ar not perhap mere superfici estim mere provision perspect besid be probabl made from some corner perhap from belowfrog perspect as it were to borrow an express current among painter in spite of all the valu which mai belong to the true the posit and

wish to concern himself with such danger perhaps for that investig on must await the advent of a new order of philosoph such as will have other tast and inclin the revers of those hitherto prevalentphilosoph of the danger perhap in everi sens of the term and to speak in all serious i see such new philosoph begin to appear have kept a sharp ey on philosoph and have read between their line long enough i now sai to myself that the greater part of consciou think must be count among the instinct function and it is so even in the case of philosoph think on ha here to learn anew as on learn anew about hered and innat as littl as the act of birth come into consider in the whole process and procedur of hered just as littl is beingconsci oppos to the instinct in ani decis sens the greater part of the consciou think of a philosoph is secretli influenc by hi instinct and forc into definit channel and behind all logic and it seem sovereignti of movement there ar valuat or to speak more plainli physiolog demand for the mainten of a definit mode of life for exampl that the certain is worth more than the uncertain that illus is less valuabl than truth such valuat in spite of their regul import for us might notwithstand be onli superfici valuat special kind of niaiseri such as mai be necessari for the mainten of be such as ourselv suppos in effect that man is not just the measur of thing the fals of an opinion is not for us ani object to it it is here perhap that our new languag sound most strang the question is how far an opinion is lifefurth lifepreserv speciespreserv perhap speciesrear and we ar fundament inclin to maintain that the falsest opinion to which the synthet judgment a priori belong ar the most indispens to us that without a recognit of logic fiction without a comparison of realiti with the pure imagin world of the absolut and immut without a constant counterfeit of the world by mean of number man could not livethat the renunci of fals opinion would be a renunci of life a negat of life to recognis untruth as a condit of life that is certainli to impugn the tradit idea of valu in a danger manner and a philosophi which ventur to do so ha

thi masquerad of a sickli reclus betrai it ha gradual becom clear to me what everi great philosophi up till now ha consist ofnam the confess of it origin and a speci of involuntari and unconsci autobiographi and moreov that the moral or immor purpos in everi philosophi ha constitut the true vital germ out of which the entir plant ha alwai grown inde to understand how the abstrusest metaphys assert of a philosoph have been arriv at it is alwai well and wise to first ask oneself what moral do thei or doe he aim at accordingli i do not believ that an impuls to knowledg is the father of philosophi but that anoth impuls here as elsewher ha onli made us of knowledg and mistaken knowledg as an instrument but whoever consid the fundament impuls of man with a view to determin how far thei mai have here act as inspir genii or as demon and cobold will find that thei have all practic philosophi at on time or anoth and that each on of them would have been onli too glad to look upon itself

man the faculti of synthet judgment a priori grant that he deceiv himself in thi matter the develop and rapid flourish of german philosophi depend nevertheless on hi pride and on the eager rivalri of the younger gener to discov if possibl somethingat all event new facultiesof which to be still prouderbut let us reflect for a momentit is high time to do so how ar synthet judgment a priori possibl kant ask himselfand what is realli hi answer by mean of a mean facultybut unfortun not in five word but so circumstanti imposingli and with such displai of german profund and verbal flourish that on altogeth lose sight of the comic niaiseri allemand involv in such an answer peopl were besid themselv with delight over thi new faculti and the jubil reach it climax when kant further discov a moral faculti in manfor at that time german were still moral not yet dabbl in the polit of hard fact then came the honeymoon of german philosophi all the young theologian of the tubingen institut went

no greater wrong to the whole of thi exuber and eccentr movement which wa realli youth notwithstand that it disguis itself so boldli in hoari and senil concept than to take it serious or even treat it with moral indign enough howeverth world grew older and the dream vanish a time came when peopl rub their forehead and thei still rub them todai peopl had been dream and first and foremostold kant by

virtu dormitiva repli the doctor in molier quia est in eo virtu dormitiva cuju est natura sensu assoupir but such repli belong to the realm of comedi and it is high time to replac the kantian question how ar synthet judgment a priori possibl by anoth question why is belief in such judgment necessaryin effect it is high time that we should understand that such judgment must be believ to be true for the sake of the preserv of creatur like ourselv though thei still might natur be fals judgment or more plainli spoken and roughli and readilysynthet judgment a priori should not be possibl at all we

to call to mind the enorm influenc which german philosophyi hope you understand it right to invert comma goosefeetha exercis throughout the whole of europ there is no doubt that a certain virtu

over the sens that ha hitherto been gain on earth on must howev go still further and also declar war relentless war to the knife against the atomist requir which still lead a danger afterlif in place

henceforth to have legitim right in scienc in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstit which have hitherto flourish with almost tropic luxuri around the idea of the soul he is

the work of our organ but then our organ themselv would be the work of our organ it seem to me that thi is a complet reductio ad absurdum if the concept causa sui is someth fundament absurd consequ the extern world is not the work of our organ there ar still harmless selfobserv who believ that there ar immedi certainti for instanc i think or as the superstit of schopenhau put it i will as though cognit here got hold of it object pure and simpli as the thing in itself without ani falsif take place either on the part of the subject or the object i would repeat it howev a hundr time that immedi certainti as well as absolut knowledg and the thing in itself involv a contradictio in adjecto we realli ought to free ourselv from the mislead signific of word the peopl on their part mai think that cognit is know all about thing but the philosoph must sai to himself when i analyz the process that is express in the sentenc i think i find a whole seri of dare assert the argument proof of which would be difficult perhap imposs for instanc that it is i who think that there must necessarili be someth that think that think is an activ and oper on the part of a be who is thought of as a caus

determin whether that which is just happen is not perhap will or feel in short the assert i think assum that i compar my state at the present moment with other state of myself which i know in order to determin what it is on account of thi retrospect connect with further knowledg it ha at ani rate no immedi certainti for mein place of the immedi certainti in which the peopl mai believ in the special case the philosoph thu find a seri of metaphys question present to him verit conscienc question of the intellect to wit whenc did i get the notion of think why do i believ in caus and effect what give me the right to speak of an ego and even of an ego as caus and final of an ego as caus of thought he who ventur to answer these metaphys question at onc by an appeal to a sort of intuit percept like the person who sai i think and know that thi at least is true actual and certainwil encount a smile and two note of interrog in a philosoph nowadai sir the philosoph will perhap give him to understand it is improb that you ar not mistaken but why should it be the truth with regard to the superstit of logician i shall never tire of emphas a small ters fact which is unwillingli recogn by these credul mindsnam that a thought come when it wish and not when i wish so that it is a pervers of the fact of the case to sai that the subject i is the condit of the predic think on think but that thi on is precis the famou old ego is to put it mildli onli a supposit an assert and assuredli not an immedi certainti after all on ha even gone too far with thi on thinkseven the on contain an interpret of the

line that the older atom sought besid the oper power the materi particl wherein it resid and out of which it operatesth atom more rigor mind howev learnt at last to get along without thi earthresiduum and perhap some dai we shall accustom ourselv even from the logician point of view to get along without the littl on to which the worthi old ego ha refin itself it is certainli not the least charm of a theori that it is refut it is precis therebi that it attract the more subtl mind it seem that the hundredtimesrefut theori of the free will ow it persist to thi charm alon some on is alwai appear who feel himself strong enough to refut it philosoph ar accustom to speak of the will as though it were the bestknown thing in the world inde schopenhau ha given us to understand that the will alon is realli known to us absolut and complet known without deduct or addit but it again and again seem to me that in thi case schopenhau also onli did what philosoph ar in the habit of doingh seem to have adopt a popular prejudic and exagger it will seem to me to be abov all someth complic someth that is a uniti onli in nameand it is precis in a name that popular prejudic lurk which ha got the masteri over the inadequ precaut of philosoph in all ag so let us for onc be more cautiou let us be unphilosoph let us sai that in all will there is firstli a plural of sensat name the sensat of the condit awai from which we go the sensat of the condit toward which we go the sensat of thi from and toward itself and then besid an accompani muscular sensat which even without our put in motion arm and leg commenc it action by forc of habit directli we will anyth therefor just as sensat and inde mani kind of sensat ar to be recogn as ingredi of the will so in the second place think is also to be recogn in everi act of the will there is a rule thoughtand let us not imagin it possibl to sever thi thought from the will as if the will would then remain over in the third place the will is not onli a complex of sensat and think but it is abov all an emot and in fact the emot of the command that which is term freedom of the will is essenti the emot of supremaci in respect to him who must obei i am free he must obeythi conscious is inher in everi will and equal so the strain of the attent the straight look which fix itself exclus on on thing the uncondit judgment that thi and noth els is necessari now the inward certainti that obedi will be renderedand whatev els pertain to the posit of the command a man who will command someth within himself which render obedi or which he believ render obedi but now let us notic what is the strangest thing about the willthi affair so extrem complex for which the peopl have onli on name inasmuch as in the given circumst we ar at the same time the command and the obei parti and as the obei parti we know the sensat of constraint impuls pressur resist and motion which usual commenc immedi after the act of will inasmuch as on the other hand we ar accustom to disregard thi dualiti and to deceiv ourselv about it by mean of the synthet term i a whole seri of erron conclus and consequ of fals judgment about the will itself ha becom attach to the act of willingto such a degre that he who will believ firmli that will suffic for action sinc in the major of case there ha onli been exercis of will when the effect of the commandconsequ obedi

more uncertain perhap more delic more fragil more bruis but full of hope which as yet lack name full of a new will and current full of a new illwil and countercurr but what am i do my friend of whom

prais in such a manner for as it happen to everi on who from childhood onward ha alwai been on hi leg and in foreign land i have also encount on my path mani strang and danger spirit abov all howev and again and again the on of whom i have just spoken in fact no less a personag than the god dionysu the great equivoc and tempter to whom as you know i onc offer in all secreci and rever my firstfruitsth last as it seem to me who ha offer a sacrific to him for i have found no on who could understand what i wa then do in the meantim howev i have learn much far too much about the philosophi of thi god and as i said from mouth to mouthi the last discipl and initi of the god dionysu and perhap i might at last begin to give you my friend as far as i am allow a littl tast of thi philosophi in a hush voic as is but seemli for it ha to do with much that is secret new strang wonder and uncanni the veri fact that dionysu is a philosoph and that therefor god also philosoph seem to me a novelti which is not unensnar and might perhap arous suspicion precis among philosophersamong you my friend there is less to be said against it except that it come too late and not at the right time for as it ha been disclos to me you ar loth nowadai to believ in god and god it mai happen too that in the frank of my stori i must go further than is agreeabl to the strict usag of your ear certainli the god in question went further veri much further in such dialogu and wa alwai mani pace ahead of me inde if it were allow i should have to give him accord to human usag fine ceremoni tide of lustr and merit i should have to extol hi courag as investig and discover hi fearless honesti truth and love of wisdom but such a god doe not know what to do with all that respect trumperi and pomp keep that he would sai for thyself and those like thee and whoever els requir it ihav no reason to cover my naked on suspect that thi kind of divin and philosoph perhap lack shameh onc said under certain circumst i love mankindand refer therebi to ariadn who wa present in my opinion man is an agreeabl brave invent anim that ha not hi equal upon earth he make hi wai even through all labyrinth i like man and often think how i can still further advanc him and make him stronger more evil and more profoundstrong more evil and more profound i ask in horror ye he said again stronger more evil and more profound also more beautifuland therebi the temptergod smile with hi halcyon smile as though he had just paid some charm compliment on here see at onc that it is not onli shame that thi divin lacksand in gener there ar good ground for suppos that in some thing the god could all of them come to us men for instruct we men aremor human ala what ar you after all my written and paint thought
