written a letter sinc i sat opposit to you all morn i see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamp and a thick bundl of postcard what could you go into the postoffic for then but to send a wire elimin all other factor and the on which remain must be the truth in thi case it certainli is so i repli after a littl thought the thing howev is as you sai of the simplest would you think me impertin if i were to put your theori to a more sever test on the contrari he answer it would prevent me from take a second dose of cocain i should be delight to look into ani problem which you might submit to me i have heard you sai that it is difficult for a man to have ani object in daili us without leav the impress of hi individu upon it in such a wai that a train observ might read it now i have here a watch which ha recent come into my possess would you have the kind to let me have an opinion upon the charact or habit of the late owner i hand him over the watch with some slight feel of amus in my heart for the test wa as i thought an imposs on and i intend it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmat tone which he occasion assum he balanc the watch in hi hand gaze hard at the dial open the back and examin the work first with hi nake ey and then with a power convex len i could hardli keep from smile at hi crestfallen face when he final snap the case to and hand it back there ar hardli ani data he remark the watch ha been recent clean which rob me of my most suggest fact you ar right i answer it wa clean befor be sent to me in my heart i accus my companion of put forward a most lame and impot excus to cover hi failur what data could he expect from an unclean watch though unsatisfactori my research ha not been entir barren he observ stare up at the ceil with dreami lacklustr ey subject to your correct i should judg that the watch belong to your elder brother who inherit it from your father that you gather no doubt from the h w upon the back quit so the w suggest your own name the date of the watch is nearli fifti year back and the initi ar as old as the watch so it wa made for the last gener jewelri usual descend to the eldest son and he is most like to have the same name as the father your father ha if i rememb right been dead mani year it ha therefor been in the hand of your eldest brother right so far said i anyth els he wa a man of untidi habitsveri untidi and careless he wa left with good prospect but he threw awai hi chanc live for some time in poverti with occasion short interv of prosper and final take to drink he di that is all i can gather i sprang from my chair and limp impati about the room with consider bitter in my heart thi is unworthi of you holm i said i could not have believ that you would have descend to thi you have made inquir into the histori of my unhappi brother and you now pretend to deduc thi knowledg in some fanci wai you cannot expect me to believ that you have read all thi from hi old watch it is unkind and to speak plainli ha a touch of charlatan in it my dear doctor said he kindli prai accept my apolog view the matter as an abstract problem i had forgotten how person and pain a thing it might be to you i assur you howev that i never even knew that you had a brother until you hand me the watch then how in the name of all that is wonder did you get these fact thei ar absolut correct in everi particular ah that is good luck i could onli sai what wa the balanc of probabl i did not at all expect to be so accur but it wa not mere guesswork no no i never guess it is a shock habitdestruct to the logic faculti what seem strang to you is onli so becaus you do not follow my train of thought or observ the small fact upon which larg infer mai depend for exampl i began by state that your brother wa careless when you observ the lower part of that watchcas you notic that it is not onli dint in two place but it is cut and mark all over from the habit of keep other hard object such as coin or kei in the same pocket sure it is no great feat to assum that a man who treat a fiftyguinea watch so cavalierli must be a careless man neither is it a veri farfetch infer that a man who inherit on articl of such valu is pretti well provid for in other respect i nod to show that i follow hi reason it is veri customari for pawnbrok in england when thei take a watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pinpoint upon the insid of the case it is more handi than a label as there is no risk of the number be lost or transpos there ar no less than four such number visibl to my len on the insid of thi case inferencethat your brother wa often at low water secondari inferencethat he had occasion burst of prosper or he could not have redeem the pledg final i ask you to look at the inner plate which contain the keyhol look at the thousand of scratch all round the holemark where the kei ha slip what sober man kei could have score those groov but you will never see a drunkard watch without them he wind it at night and he leav these trace of hi unsteadi hand where is the mysteri in all thi it is as clear as daylight i answer i regret the injustic which i did you i should

i heard him lock the door as i came downstair what time wa that it wa ten oclock and now he is dead and the polic will be call in and i shall be suspect of have had a hand in it oh ye i am sure i shall but you dont think so gentlemen sure you dont think that it wa i is it like that i would have brought you here if it were i oh dear oh dear i know that i shall go mad he jerk hi arm and stamp hi

to assist them in everi wai we shall wait here until your return the littl man obei in a halfstupefi fashion and we heard him stumbl down the stair in the dark chapter vi sherlock holm give a demonstr now watson said holm rub hi hand we have half an hour to ourselv let us make good us of it my case is as i have told you almost complet but we must not err on the side of overconfid simpl as the case seem now there mai be someth deeper underli it simpl i ejacul sure said he with someth of the air of a clinic professor expound to hi class just sit in the corner there that your footprint mai not complic matter now to work in the first place how did these folk come and how did thei go the door ha not been open sinc last night how of the window he carri the lamp across to it mutter hi observ aloud the while but address them to himself rather than to me window is snib on the inner side framework is solid no hing at the side let us open it no waterpip near roof quit out of reach yet a man ha mount by the window it rain a littl last night here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill and here is a circular muddi mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the tabl see here watson thi is realli a veri pretti demonstr i look at the round welldefin muddi disc thi is not a footmark said i it is someth much more valuabl to us it is the impress of a wooden stump you see here on the sill is the bootmark a heavi boot with the broad metal heel and besid it is the mark of the timberto it is the woodenleg man quit so but there ha been some on elsea veri abl and effici alli could you scale that wall doctor i look out of the open window the moon still shone brightli on that angl of the hous we were a good sixti feet from the ground and look where i would i could see no foothold nor as much as a crevic in the brickwork it is absolut imposs i answer without aid it is so but suppos you had a friend up here who lower you thi good stout rope which i see in the corner secur on end of it to thi great hook in the wall then i think if you were an activ man you might swarm up wooden leg and all you would depart of cours in the same fashion and your alli would draw up the rope unti it from the hook shut the window snib it on the insid and get awai in the wai that he origin came as a minor point it mai be note he continu finger the rope that our woodenleg friend though a fair climber wa not a profession sailor hi hand were far from horni my len disclos more than on bloodmark especi toward the end of the rope from which i gather that he slip down with such veloc that he took the skin off hi hand thi is all veri well said i but the thing becom more unintellig than ever how about thi mysteri alli how came he into the room ye the alli repeat holm pensiv there ar featur of interest about thi alli he lift the case from the region of the commonplac i fanci that thi alli break fresh ground in the annal of crime in thi countrythough parallel case suggest themselv from india and if my memori serv me from senegambia how came he then i reiter the door is lock the window is inaccess wa it through the chimnei the grate is much too small he answer i had alreadi consid that possibl how then i persist you will not appli my precept he said shake hi head how often have i said to you that when you have elimin the imposs whatev remain howev improb must be the truth we know that he did not come through the door the window or the chimnei we also know that he could not have been conceal in the room as there is no conceal possibl whenc then did he come he came through the hole in the roof i cri of cours he did he must have done so if you will have the kind to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our research to the room aboveth secret room in which

obtain your result in thi case even more than i did in the jefferson hope murder the thing seem to me to be deeper and more inexplic how for exampl could you describ with such confid the woodenleg man pshaw my dear boi it wa simplic itself i dont wish to be theatric it is all patent and aboveboard two offic who ar in command of a convictguard learn an import secret as to buri treasur a map is drawn for them by an englishman name jonathan small you rememb that we saw the name upon the chart in captain morstan possess he had sign it in behalf of himself and hi associatesth sign of the four as he somewhat dramat call it aid by thi chart the officersor on of themget the treasur and bring it to england leav we will suppos some condit under which he receiv it unfulfil now then why did not jonathan small get the treasur himself the answer is obviou the chart is date at a time when morstan wa brought into close associ with convict jonathan small did not get the treasur becaus he and hi associ were themselv convict and could not get awai but that is mere specul said i it is more than that it is the onli hypothesi which cover the fact let us see how it fit in with the sequel major sholto remain at peac for some year happi in the possess of hi treasur then he receiv a letter from india which give him a great fright what wa that a letter to sai that the men whom he had wrong had been set free or had escap that is much more like for he would have known what their term of imprison wa it would not have been a surpris to him what doe he do then he guard himself against a woodenleg mana white man mark you for he mistak a white tradesman for him and actual fire a pistol at him now onli on white man name is on the chart the other ar hindoo or mohammedan there is no other white man therefor we mai sai with confid that the woodenleg man is ident with jonathan small doe the reason strike you as be faulti no it is clear and concis well now let us put ourselv in the place of jonathan small let us look at it from hi point of view he come to england with the doubl idea of regain what he would consid to be hi right and of have hi reveng upon the man who had wrong him he found out where sholto live and veri possibl he establish commun with some on insid the hous there is thi butler lal rao whom we have not seen mr bernston give him far from a good charact small could not find out howev where the treasur wa hid for no on ever knew save the major and on faith servant who had di suddenli small learn that the major is on hi deathb in a frenzi lest the secret of the treasur die with him he run the gauntlet of the guard make hi wai to the dy man window and is onli deter from enter by the presenc of hi two son mad with hate howev against the dead man he enter the room that night search hi privat paper in the hope of discov some memorandum relat to the treasur and final leav a momento of hi visit in the short inscript upon the card he had doubtless plan beforehand that should he slai the major he would leav some such record upon the bodi as a sign that it wa not a common murder but from the point of view of the four associ someth in the natur of an act of justic whimsic and bizarr conceit of thi kind ar common enough in the annal of crime and usual afford valuabl indic as to the crimin do you follow all thi veri clearli now what could jonathan small do he could onli continu to keep a secret watch upon the effort made to find the treasur possibl he leav england and onli come back at interv then come the discoveri of the garret and he is instantli inform of it we again trace the presenc of some confeder in the household jonathan with hi wooden leg is utterli unabl to reach the lofti room of bartholomew sholto he take with him howev a rather curiou associ who get over thi difficulti but dip hi nake foot into creasot whenc come tobi and a sixmil limp for a halfpai offic with a damag tendo achilli but it wa the associ and not jonathan who commit the crime quit so and rather to jonathan disgust to judg by the wai he stamp about when he got into the room he bore no grudg against bartholomew sholto and would have prefer if he could have been simpli bound and gag he did not wish to put hi head in a halter there wa no help for it howev the savag instinct of hi companion had broken out and the poison had done it work so jonathan small left hi record lower the treasurebox to the ground and follow it himself that wa the train of event as far as i can deciph them of cours as to hi person appear he must be middleag and must be sunburn after serv hi time in such an oven as the andaman hi height is readili calcul from the length of hi stride and we know that he wa beard hi hairi wa the on point which impress itself upon thaddeu sholto when he saw him at the window i dont know that there is anyth els the associ ah well there is no great mysteri in that but you will know all about it soon enough how sweet the morn

back to him through carlyl that wa like follow the brook to the parent lake he make on curiou but profound remark it is that the chief proof of man real great li in hi percept of hi own small it argu you see a power of comparison and of appreci which is in itself a proof of nobil there is much food for thought in richter you have not a pistol have you i have my stick it is just possibl that we mai need someth of the sort if we get to their lair jonathan i shall leav to you but if the other turn nasti i shall shoot him dead he took out hi revolv as he spoke and have load two of the chamber he

heard littl good of him and could feel no intens antipathi to hi murder the treasur howev wa a differ matter that or part of it belong rightfulli to miss morstan while there wa a chanc of recov it i wa readi to devot my life to the on object true if i found it it would probabl put her forev beyond my reach yet it would be a petti and selfish love which would be influenc by such a thought as that

togeth with the housekeep mr bernston an indian butler name lal rao and a porter or gatekeep name mcmurdo it is quit certain that the thief or thiev were well acquaint with the hous for mr joness wellknown technic knowledg and hi power of minut observ have enabl him to prove conclus that the miscreant could not have enter by the door or by the window but must have made their wai across the roof of the build and so through a trapdoor into a room which commun with that in which the bodi wa found thi fact which ha been veri clearli made out prove conclus that it wa no mere haphazard burglari the prompt and energet action of the offic of the law show the great advantag of the presenc on such occas of a singl vigor and master mind we cannot but think that it suppli an argument to those who would wish to see our detect more decentr and so brought into closer and more effect touch with the case which it is their duti to investig isnt it gorgeou said holm grin over hi coffeecup what do you think of it i think that we have had a close shave ourselv of be arrest for the crime so do i i wouldnt answer for our safeti now if he should happen to have anoth of hi attack of energi

spirit wa chafe against thi involuntari inact at breakfasttim he look worn and haggard with a littl fleck of feverish color upon either cheek you ar knock yourself up old man i remark i heard you march about in the night no i could not sleep he answer thi infern problem is consum me it is too much to be balk by so petti an obstacl when all els had been overcom i know the men the launch everyth and yet i can get no new i have set other agenc at work and us everi mean at my dispos the whole river ha been search on either side but there is no new nor ha mr smith heard of her husband i shall come to the conclus soon that thei have scuttl the craft but there ar object to that or that mr smith ha put us on a wrong scent no i think that mai be dismiss i had inquiri made and there is a launch of that descript could it have gone up the river i have consid that possibl too and there is a searchparti who will work up as far as richmond if no new come todai i shall start off myself tomorrow and go for the men rather than the boat but sure sure we shall hear someth we did not howev not a word came to us either from wiggin or from the other agenc there were articl in most of the paper upon the norwood tragedi thei all appear to be rather hostil to the unfortun thaddeu sholto no fresh detail were to be found howev in ani of them save that an inquest wa to be held upon the follow dai i walk over to camberwel in the even to report our ill success to the ladi and on my return i found holm deject and somewhat moros he would hardli repli to my question and busi himself all even in an abstrus chemic analysi which involv much heat of retort and distil of vapor end at last in a smell which fairli drove me out of the apart up to the small hour of the morn i could hear the clink of hi testtub which told me that he wa still engag in hi malodor experi in the earli dawn i woke with a start and wa surpris to find him stand by my bedsid clad in a rude sailor dress with a peajacket and a coars red scarf round hi neck i am off down the river watson said he i have been turn it over in my mind and i can see onli on wai out of it it is worth try at all event sure i can come with you then said i no you can be much more us if you will remain here as my repres i am loath to go for it is quit on the card that some messag mai come dure the dai though wiggin wa despond about it last night i want you to open all note and telegram and to act on your own judgment if ani new should come can i reli upon you most certainli i am afraid that you will not be abl to wire to me for i can hardli tell yet where i mai find myself if i am in luck howev i mai not be gone so veri long i shall have new of some sort or other befor i get back i had heard noth of him by breakfasttim on open the standard howev i found that there wa a fresh allus to the busi with refer to the upper norwood tragedi it remark we have reason to believ that the matter promis to be even more complex and mysteri than wa origin suppos fresh evid ha shown that it is quit imposs that mr thaddeu sholto could have been in ani wai concern in the matter he and the housekeep mr bernston were both releas yesterdai even it is believ howev that the polic have a clue as to the real culprit and that it is be prosecut by mr athelnei jone of scotland yard with all hi wellknown energi and sagac further arrest mai be expect at ani moment that is satisfactori so far as it goe thought i friend sholto is safe at ani rate i wonder what the fresh clue mai be though it seem to be a stereotyp form whenev the polic have made a blunder i toss the paper down upon the tabl but at that moment my ey caught an advertis in the agoni column it ran in thi wai lostwherea mordecai smith boatman and hi son jim left smith wharf at or about three oclock last tuesdai morn in the steam launch aurora black with two red stripe funnel black with a white band the sum of five pound will be paid to ani on who can give inform to mr smith at smith wharf or at b baker street as to the whereabout of the said mordecai smith and the launch aurora thi wa clearli holmess do the baker street address wa enough to prove that it struck me as rather ingeni becaus it might be read by the fugit without their see in it more than the natur anxieti of a wife for her miss husband it wa a long dai everi time that a knock came to the door or a sharp step pass in the street i imagin that it wa either holm return or an answer to hi advertis i tri to read but my thought would wander off to our strang quest and to the illassort and villain pair whom we were pursu could there be i wonder some radic flaw in my companion reason might he be suffer from some huge selfdecept wa it not possibl that hi nimbl and specul mind had built up thi wild theori upon faulti premis i had never known him to be wrong and yet the keenest reason mai occasion be deceiv he wa like i thought to fall into error through the overrefin of hi logichi prefer for a subtl and bizarr explan when a plainer and more commonplac on lai readi to hi hand yet on the other hand i had myself seen the evid and i had heard the reason for hi deduct when i look back on the long chain of curiou circumst mani of them trivial in themselv but all tend in the same direct i could not disguis from myself that even if holmess explan were incorrect the true theori must be equal outr and startl at three oclock in the afternoon there wa a loud peal at the bell an authorit voic in the hall and to my surpris no less a person than mr athelnei jone wa shown up to me veri differ wa he howev from the brusqu and master professor of common sens who had taken over the case so confid at upper norwood hi express wa downcast and hi bear meek and even apologet gooddai sir gooddai said he mr sherlock holm is out i understand ye and i cannot be sure when he will be back but perhap you would care to wait take that chair and try on of these cigar thank you i dont mind if i do said he

alibi which could not be shaken from the time that he left hi brother room he wa never out of sight of some on or other so it could not be he who climb over roof and through trapdoor it a veri dark case and my profession credit is at stake i should be veri glad of a littl assist we all need help sometim said i your friend mr sherlock holm is a wonder man sir said he in a huski and confidenti voic he a man who is not to be beat i have known that young man go into a good mani case but i never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon he is irregular in hi method and a littl quick perhap in jump at theori but on the whole i think he would have made a most promis offic and i dont care who know it i have had a wire from him thi morn by which i understand that he ha got some clue to thi sholto busi here is the messag he took the telegram out of hi pocket and hand it to me it wa date from poplar at twelv oclock go to baker street at onc it said if i have not return wait for me i am close on the track of the sholto gang you can come with us tonight if you want to be in at the finish thi sound well he ha evid pick up the scent again said i ah then he ha been at fault too exclaim jone with evid satisfact even the best of us ar thrown off sometim of cours thi mai prove to be a fals alarm but it is my duti as an offic of the law to allow no chanc to slip but there is some on at the door perhap thi is he a heavi step wa heard ascend the stair with a great wheez and rattl as from a man who wa sore put to it for breath onc or twice he stop as though the climb were

fast on we shot past the long line of load barg as though thei were stationari holm smile with satisfact as we overhaul a river steamer and left her behind us we ought to be abl to catch anyth on the river he said well hardli that but there ar not mani launch to beat us we shall have to catch the aurora and she ha a name for be a clipper i will tell you how the land li watson you recollect how annoi i wa at be balk by so small a thing ye well i gave my mind a thorough rest by plung into a chemic analysi on of our greatest statesmen ha said that a chang of work is the best rest so it is when i had succeed in dissolv the hydrocarbon which i wa at work at i came back to our problem of the sholto and thought the whole matter out again my boi had been up the river and down the river without result the launch wa not at ani landingstag or wharf nor had it return yet it could hardli have been scuttl to hide their tracesthough that alwai remain as a possibl hypothesi if all els fail i knew thi man small had a certain degre of low cun but i did not think him capabl of anyth in the natur of delic finess that is usual a product of higher educ i then reflect that sinc he had certainli been in london some timea we had evid that he maintain a continu watch over pondicherri lodgeh could hardli leav at a moment notic but would need some littl time if it were onli a dai to arrang hi affair that wa the balanc of probabl at ani rate it seem to me to be a littl weak said i it is more probabl that he had arrang hi affair befor ever he set out upon hi expedit no i hardli think so thi lair of hi would be too valuabl a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he wa sure that he could do without it but a second consider struck me jonathan small must have felt that the peculiar appear of hi companion howev much he mai have topcoat him would give rise to gossip and possibl be associ with thi norwood tragedi he wa quit sharp enough to see that thei had start from their headquart under cover of dark and he would wish to get back befor it wa broad light now it wa past three oclock accord to mr smith when thei got the boat it would be quit bright and peopl would be about in an hour or so therefor i argu thei did not go veri far thei paid smith well to hold hi tongu reserv hi launch for the final escap and hurri to their lodg with the treasurebox in a coupl of night when thei had time to see what view the paper took and whether there wa ani suspicion thei would make their wai under cover of dark to some ship at gravesend or in the down where no doubt thei had alreadi arrang for passag to america or the coloni but the launch thei could not have taken that to their lodg quit so i argu that the launch must be no great wai off in spite of it invis i then put myself in the place of small and look at it as a man of hi capac would he would probabl consid that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easi if the polic did happen to get on hi track how then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when want i wonder what i should do myself if i were in hi shoe i could onli think of on wai of do it i might land the launch over to some boatbuild or repair with direct to make a trifl chang in her she would then be remov to hi shed or yard and so be effectu conceal while at the same time i could have her at a few hour notic that seem simpl enough it is just these veri simpl thing which ar extrem liabl to be overlook howev i determin to act on the idea i start at onc in thi harmless seaman rig and inquir at all the yard down the river i drew blank at fifteen but at the sixteenthjacobsonsi learn that the aurora had been hand over to them two dai ago by a woodenleg man with some trivial direct as to her rudder there aint naught amiss with her rudder said the foreman there she li with the red streak at that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the miss owner he wa rather the wors for liquor i should not of cours have known him but he bellow out hi name and the name of hi launch i want her tonight at eight oclock said heeight oclock sharp mind for i have two gentlemen who wont be kept wait thei had evid paid him well for he wa veri flush of monei chuck shill about to the men i follow him some distanc but he subsid into an alehous so i went back to the yard and happen to pick up on of my boi on the wai i station him as a sentri over the launch he is to stand at water edg and wave hi handkerchief to us when thei start we shall be ly off in the stream and it will be a strang thing if we do not take men treasur and all you have plan it all veri neatli whether thei ar the right men or not said jone but if the affair were in my hand i should have had a bodi of polic in jacobson yard and arrest them when thei came down which would have been never thi man small is a pretti shrewd fellow he would send a scout on ahead and if anyth made him suspici lie snug for anoth week but you might have stuck to mordecai smith and so been led to their hidingplac said i in that case i should have wast my dai i think that it is a hundr to on against smith know where thei live as long as he ha liquor and good pai why should he ask question thei send him messag what to do no i thought over everi possibl cours and thi is the best while thi convers had been proceed we had been shoot the long seri of bridg which span the thame as we pass the citi the last rai of the sun were gild the cross upon the summit of st paul it wa twilight befor we reach the tower that is jacobson yard said holm point to a bristl of mast and rig on the surrei side cruis gentli up and down here under cover of thi string of lighter he took a pair of nightglass from hi pocket and gaze some time at the shore i see my sentri at hi post he remark but no sign of a handkerchief suppos we go downstream a short wai and lie in wait for them said jone eagerli we were all eager by thi time even the policemen and stoker who had a veri vagu idea of what wa go forward we have no right to take anyth for grant holm answer it is certainli ten to on that thei go downstream but we cannot be certain from thi point we can see the entranc of the yard and thei can hardli see us it will be a clear night and plenti of light we must stai where we ar see how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight thei ar come from work in the yard dirtylook rascal but i suppos everi on ha some littl immort spark conceal about him you would not think it to look at them there is no a priori probabl about it a strang enigma is man some on call him a soul conceal in an anim i suggest winwood read is good upon the subject said holm he remark that while the individu man is an insolubl puzzl in the aggreg he becom a mathemat certainti you can for exampl never foretel what ani on man will do but you can sai with precis what an averag number will be up to individu vari but percentag remain constant so sai the statistician but do i see a handkerchief sure there is a white flutter over yonder ye it is your boi i cri i can see him plainli and there is the aurora exclaim holm and go like the devil full speed ahead engin make after that launch with the yellow light by heaven i shall never forgiv myself if she prove to have the heel of us she had slip unseen through the yardentr and pass behind two or three small craft so that she had fairli got her speed up befor we saw her now she wa fly down the stream near in to the shore go at a tremend rate jone look grave at her and shook hi head she is veri fast he said i doubt if we shall catch her we must catch her cri holm between hi teeth heap it on stoker make her do all she can if we burn the boat we must have them we were fairli after her now the furnac roar and the power engin whizz and clank like a great metal heart her sharp steep prow cut through the riverwat and sent two roll wave to right and to left of us with everi throb of the engin we sprang and quiver like a live thing on great yellow lantern in our bow threw a long flicker funnel of light in front of us right ahead a dark blur upon the water show where the aurora lai and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she wa go we flash past barg steamer merchantvessel in and out behind thi on and round the other voic hail us out of the dark but still the aurora thunder on and still we follow close upon her track pile it on men pile it on cri holm look down into the engineroom while the fierc glow from below beat upon hi eager aquilin face get everi pound of steam you can i think we gain a littl said jone with hi ey on the aurora i am sure of it said i we shall be up with her in a veri few minut at that moment howev as our evil fate would have it a tug with three barg in tow blunder in between us it wa onli by put our helm hard down that we avoid a collis and befor we could round them and recov our wai the aurora had gain a good two hundr yard she wa still howev well in view and the murki uncertain twilight wa set into a clear starlit night our boiler were strain to their utmost and the frail shell vibrat and creak with the fierc energi which wa drive us along we had shot through the pool past the west india dock down the long deptford reach and up again after round the isl of dog the dull blur in front of us resolv itself now clearli enough into the dainti aurora jone turn our searchlight upon her so that we could plainli see the figur upon her deck on man sat by the stern with someth black between hi knee over which he stoop besid him lai a dark mass which look like a newfoundland dog the boi held the tiller while against the red glare of the furnac i could see old smith strip to the waist and shovel coal for dear life thei mai have had some doubt at first as to whether we were realli pursu them but now as we follow everi wind and turn which thei took there could no longer be ani question about it at greenwich we were about three hundr pace behind them at blackwal we could not have been more than two hundr and fifti i have cours mani creatur in mani countri dure my checker career but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as thi mad fly manhunt down the thame steadili we drew in upon them yard by yard in the silenc of the night we could hear the pant and clank of their machineri the man in the stern still crouch upon the deck and hi arm were move as though he were busi while everi now and then he would look up and measur with a glanc the distanc which still separ us nearer we came and nearer jone yell to them to stop we were not more than four boat length behind them both boat fly at a tremend pace it wa a clear reach of the river with bark level upon on side and the melancholi plumstead marsh upon the other at our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook hi two clinch fist at us curs the while in a high crack voic he wa a goodsiz power man and as he stood pois himself with leg astrid i could see that from the thigh downward there wa but a wooden stump upon the right side at the sound of hi strident angri cri there wa movement in the huddl bundl upon the deck it straighten itself into a littl black manth smallest i have ever seenwith a great misshapen head and a shock of tangl dishevel hair holm had alreadi drawn hi revolv and i whip out mine at the sight of thi savag distort creatur he wa wrap in some sort of dark ulster or blanket which left onli hi face expos but that face wa enough to give a man a sleepless night never have i seen featur so deepli mark with all bestial and cruelti hi small ey glow and burn with a sombr light and hi thick lip were writh back from hi teeth which grin and chatter at us with a half anim furi fire if he rais hi hand said holm quietli we were within a boatslength by thi time and almost within touch of our quarri i can see the two of them now as thei stood the white man with hi leg far apart shriek out curs and the unhallow dwarf with hi hideou face and hi strong yellow teeth gnash at us in the light of our lantern it wa well that we had so clear a view of him even as we look he pluck out from under hi cover a short round piec of wood like a schoolrul and clap it to hi lip our pistol rang out togeth he whirl round threw up hi arm and with a kind of choke cough fell sidewai into the stream i caught on glimps of hi venom menac ey amid the white swirl of the water at the same moment the woodenleg man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down so that hi boat made straight in for the southern bank while we shot past her stern onli clear her by a few feet we were round after her in an instant but she wa alreadi nearli at the bank it wa a wild and desol place where the moon glimmer upon a wide expans of marshland with pool of stagnant water and bed of decai veget the launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mudbank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water the fugit sprang out but hi stump instantli sank it whole length into the sodden soil in vain he struggl and writh not on step could he possibl take either forward or backward he yell in impot rage and kick frantic into the mud with hi other foot but hi struggl onli bore hi wooden pin the deeper into the sticki bank when we brought our launch alongsid he wa so firmli anchor that it wa onli by throw the end of a rope over hi shoulder that we were abl to haul him out and to drag him like some evil fish over our side the two smith father and son sat sullenli in their launch but came aboard meekli enough when command the aurora herself we haul off and made fast to our stern a solid iron chest of indian workmanship stood upon the deck thi there could be no question wa the same that had contain the illomen treasur of the sholto there wa no kei but it wa of consider weight so we transfer it carefulli to our own littl cabin as we steam slowli upstream again we flash our searchlight in everi direct but there wa no sign of the island somewher in the dark ooz at the bottom of the thame lie the bone of that strang visitor to our shore see here said holm point to the wooden hatchwai we were hardli quick enough with our pistol there sure enough just behind where we had been stand stuck on of those murder dart which we knew so well it must have whizz between us at the instant that we fire holm smile at it and shrug hi shoulder in hi easi fashion but i confess that it turn me sick to think of the horribl death which had pass so close to us that night chapter xi the great agra treasur our captiv sat in the cabin opposit to the iron box which he had done so much and wait so long to gain he wa a sunburn recklessei fellow with a network of line and wrinkl all over hi mahogani featur which told of a hard openair life there wa a singular promin about hi beard chin which mark a man who wa not to be easili turn from hi purpos hi ag mai have been fifti or thereabout for hi black curli hair wa thickli shot with grai hi face in repos wa not an unpleas on though hi heavi brow and aggress chin gave him as i had late seen a terribl express when move to anger he sat now with hi handcuf hand upon hi lap and hi head sunk upon hi breast while he look with hi keen twinkl ey at the box which had been the caus of hi illdo it seem to me that there wa more sorrow than anger in hi rigid and contain counten onc he look up at me with a gleam of someth like humor in hi ey well jonathan small said holm light a cigar i am sorri that it ha come to thi and so am i sir he answer frankli i dont believ that i can swing over the job i give you my word on the book that i never rais hand against mr sholto it wa that littl hellhound tonga who shot on of hi curs dart into him i had no part in it sir i wa as griev as if it had been my bloodrel i welt the littl devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it wa done and i could not undo it again have a cigar said holm and you had best take a pull out of my flask for you ar veri wet how could you expect so small and weak a man as thi black fellow to overpow mr sholto and hold him while you were climb the rope you seem to know as much about it as if you were there sir the truth is that i hope to find the room clear i knew the habit of the hous pretti well and it wa the time when mr sholto usual went down to hi supper i shall make no secret of the busi the best defenc that i can make is just the simpl truth now if it had been the old major i would have swung for him with a light heart i would have thought no more of knife him than of smoke thi cigar but it curs hard that i should be lag over thi young sholto with whom i had no quarrel whatev you ar under the charg of mr athelnei jone of scotland yard he is go to bring you up to my room and i shall ask you for a true account of the matter you must make a clean breast of it for if you do i hope that i mai be of us to you i think i can prove that the poison act so quickli that the man wa dead befor ever you reach the room that he wa sir i never got such a turn in my life as when i saw him grin at me with hi head on hi shoulder as i climb through the window it fairli shook me sir id have half kill tonga for it if he had not scrambl off that wa how he came to leav hi club and some of hi dart too as he tell me which i dare sai help to put you on our track though how you kept on it is more than i can tell i dont feel no malic against you for it but it doe seem a queer thing he ad with a bitter smile that i who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of monei should spend the first half of my life build a breakwat in the andaman and am like to spend the other half dig drain at dartmoor it wa an evil dai for me when first i clap ey upon the merchant achmet and had to do with the agra treasur which never brought anyth but a curs yet upon the man who own it to him it brought murder to major sholto it brought fear and guilt to me it ha meant slaveri for life at thi moment athelnei jone thrust hi broad face and heavi shoulder into the tini cabin quit a famili parti he remark i think i shall have a pull at that flask holm well i think we mai all congratul each

cold struck through my heart when i found it wa dawson wife all cut into ribbon and half eaten by jackal and nativ dog a littl further up the road dawson himself wa ly on hi face quit dead with an empti revolv in hi hand and four sepoi ly across each other in front of him i rein up my hors wonder which wai i should turn but at that moment i saw thick smoke curl up from abelwhit bungalow and the flame begin to burst through the roof i knew then that i could do my employ no good but would onli throw my own life awai if i meddl in the matter from where i stood i could see hundr of the black fiend with their red coat still on their back danc and howl round the burn hous some of them point at me and a coupl of bullet sang past my head so i broke awai across the paddyfield and found myself late at night safe within the wall at agra as it prove howev there wa no great safeti there either the whole countri wa up like a swarm of bee wherev the english could collect in littl band thei held just the ground that their gun command everywher els thei were helpless fugit it wa a fight of the million against the hundr and the cruellest part of it wa that these men that we fought against foot hors and gunner were our own pick troop whom we had taught and train handl our own weapon and blow our own buglecal at agra there were the d bengal fusili some sikh two troop of hors and a batteri of artilleri a volunt corp of clerk and merchant had been form and thi i join wooden leg and all we went out to meet the rebel at shahgung earli in juli and we beat them back for a time but our powder gave out and we had to fall back upon the citi noth but the worst new came to us from everi sidewhich is not to be wonder at for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it lucknow is rather better than a hundr mile to the east and cawnpor about as far to the south from everi point on the compass there wa noth but tortur and murder and outrag the citi of agra is a great place swarm with fanat and fierc devilworshipp of all sort our hand of men were lost among the narrow wind street our leader move across the river therefor and took up hi posit in the old fort at agra i dont know if ani of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anyth of that old fort it is a veri queer placeth queerest that ever i wa in and i have been in some rum corner too first of all it is enorm in size i should think that the enclosur must be acr and acr there is a modern part which took all our garrison women children store and everyth els with plenti of room over but the modern part is noth like the size of the old quarter where nobodi goe and which is given over to the scorpion and the centiped it is all full of great desert hall and wind passag and long corridor twist in and out so that it is easi enough for folk to get lost in it for thi reason it wa seldom that ani on went into it though now and again a parti with torch might go explor the river wash along the front of the old fort and so protect it but on the side and behind there ar mani door and these had to be guard of cours in the old quarter as well as in that which wa actual held by our troop we were shorthand with hardli men enough to man the angl of the build and to serv the gun it wa imposs for us therefor to station a strong guard at everi on of the innumer gate what we did wa to organ a central guardhous in the middl of the fort and to leav each gate under the charg of on white man and two or three nativ i wa select to take charg dure certain hour of the night of a small isol door upon the southwest side of the build two sikh trooper were place under my command and i wa instruct if anyth went wrong to fire my musket when i might reli upon help come at onc from the central guard as the guard wa a good two hundr pace awai howev and as the space between wa cut up into a labyrinth of passag and corridor i had great doubt as to whether thei could arriv in time to be of ani us in case of an actual attack well i wa pretti proud at have thi small command given me sinc i wa a raw recruit and a gameleg on at that for two night i kept the watch with my punjaube thei were tall fiercelook chap mahomet singh and abdullah khan by name both old fightingmen who had born arm against us at chilianwallah thei could talk english pretti well but i could get littl out of them thei prefer to stand togeth and jabber all night in their queer sikh lingo for myself i us to stand outsid the gatewai look down on the broad wind river and on the twinkl light of the great citi the beat of drum the rattl of tomtom and the yell and howl of the rebel drunk with opium and with bang were enough to remind us all night of our danger neighbor across the stream everi two hour the offic of the night us to come round to all the post to make sure that all wa well the third night of my watch wa dark and dirti with a small drive rain it wa dreari work stand in the gatewai hour after hour in such weather i tri again and again to make my sikh talk but without much success at two in the morn the round pass and broke for a moment the weari of the night find that my companion would not be led into convers i took out my pipe and laid down my musket to strike the match in an instant the two sikh were upon me on of them snatch my firelock up and level it at my head while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between hi teeth that he would plung it into me if i move a step my first thought wa that these fellow were in leagu with the rebel and that thi wa the begin of an assault if our door were in the hand of the sepoi the place must fall and the women and children be treat as thei were in cawnpor mayb you gentlemen think that i am just make out a case for myself but i give you my word that when i thought of that though i felt the point of the knife at my throat i open my mouth with the intent of give a scream if it wa my last on which might alarm the main guard the man who held me seem to know my thought for even as i brace myself to it he whisper dont make a nois the fort is safe enough there ar no rebel dog on thi side of the river there wa the ring of truth in what he said and i knew that if i rais my voic i wa a dead man i could read it in the fellow brown ey i wait therefor in silenc to see what it wa that thei want from me listen to me sahib said the taller and fiercer of the pair the on whom thei call abdullah khan you must either be with us now or you must be silenc forev the thing is too great a on for us to hesit either you ar heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the christian or your bodi thi night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brother in the rebel armi there is no middl wai which is it to be death or life we can onli give you three minut to decid for the time is pass and all must be done befor the round come again how can i decid said i you have not told me what you want of me but i tell you now that if it is anyth against the safeti of the fort i will have no truck with it so you can drive home your knife and welcom it is noth against the fort said he we onli ask you to do that which your countrymen come to thi land for we ask you to be rich if you will be on of us thi night we will swear to you upon the nake knife and by the threefold oath which no sikh wa ever known to break that you shall have your fair share of the loot a quarter of the treasur shall be your we can sai no fairer but what is the treasur then i ask i am as readi to be rich as you can be if you will but show me how it can be done you will swear then said he by the bone of your father by the honor of your mother by the cross of your faith to rais no hand and speak no word against us either now or afterward i will swear it i answer provid that the fort is not endang then my comrad and i will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasur which shall be equal divid among the four of us there ar but three said i no dost akbar must have hi share we can tell the tale to you while we await them do you stand at the gate mahomet singh and give notic of their come the thing stand thu sahib and i tell it to you becaus i know that an oath is bind upon a feringhe and that we mai trust you had you been a ly hindoo though you had sworn by all the god in their fals templ your blood would have been upon the knife and your bodi in the water but the sikh know the englishman and the englishman know the sikh hearken then to what i have to sai there is a rajah in the northern provinc who ha much wealth though hi land ar small much ha come to him from hi father and more still he ha set by himself for he is of a low natur and hoard hi gold rather than spend it when the troubl broke out he would be friend both with the lion and the tigerwith the sepoi and with the compani raj soon howev it seem to him that the white men dai wa come for through all the land he could hear of noth but of their death and their overthrow yet be a care man he made such plan that come what might half at least of hi treasur should be left to him that which wa in gold and silver he kept by him in the vault of hi palac but the most preciou stone and the choicest pearl that he had he put in an iron box and sent it by a trusti servant who under the guis of a merchant should take it to the fort at agra there to lie until the land is at peac thu if the rebel won he would have hi monei but if the compani conquer hi jewel would be save to him have thu divid hi hoard he threw himself into the caus of the sepoi sinc thei were strong upon hi border by do thi mark you sahib hi properti becom the due of those who have been true to their salt thi pretend merchant who travel under the name of achmet is now in the citi of agra and desir to gain hi wai into the fort he ha with him as travellingcompanion my fosterbroth dost akbar who know hi secret dost akbar ha promis thi night to lead him to a sidepostern of the fort and ha chosen thi on for hi purpos here he will come present and here he will find mahomet singh and myself await him the place is lone and none shall know of hi come the world shall know of the merchant achmet no more but the great treasur of the rajah shall be divid among us what sai you to it sahib in worcestershir the life of a man seem a great and a sacr thing but it is veri differ when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been us to meet death at everi turn whether achmet the merchant live or di wa a thing as light as air to me but at the talk about the treasur my heart turn to it and i thought of what i might do in the old countri with it and how my folk would stare when thei saw their neerdowel come back with hi pocket full of gold moidor i had therefor alreadi made up my mind abdullah khan howev think that i hesit press the matter more close consid sahib said he that if thi man is taken by the command he will be hung or shot and hi jewel taken by the govern so that no man will be a rupe the better for them now sinc we do the take of him why should we not do the rest as well the jewel will be as well with us as in the compani coffer there will be enough to make everi on of us rich men and great chief no on can know about the matter for here we ar cut off from all men what could be better for the purpos sai again then sahib whether you ar with us or if we must look upon you as an enemi i am with you heart and soul said i it is well he answer hand me back my firelock you see that we trust you for your word like our is not to be broken we have now onli to wait for my brother and the merchant doe your brother know then of what you will do i ask the plan is hi he ha devis it we will go to the gate and share the watch with mahomet singh the rain wa still fall steadili for it wa just the begin of the wet season brown heavi cloud were drift across the sky and it wa hard to see more than a stonecast a deep moat lai in front of our door but the water wa in place nearli dri up and it could easili be cross it wa strang to me to be stand there with those two wild punjaube wait for the man who wa come to hi death suddenli my ey caught the glint of a shade lantern at the other side of the moat it vanish among the moundheap and then appear again come slowli in our direct here thei ar i exclaim you will challeng him sahib as usual whisper abdullah give him no caus for fear send us in with him and we shall do the rest while you stai here on guard have the lantern readi to uncov that we mai be sure that it is inde the man the light had flicker onward now stop and now advanc until i could see two dark figur upon the other side of the moat i let them scrambl down the slope bank splash through the mire and climb halfwai up to the gate befor i challeng them who goe there said i in a subdu voic friend came the answer i uncov my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them the first wa an enorm sikh with a black beard which swept nearli down to hi cummerbund outsid of a show i have never seen so tall a man the other wa a littl fat round fellow with a great yellow turban and a bundl in hi hand done up in a shawl he seem to be all in a quiver with fear for hi hand twitch as if he had the agu and hi head kept turn to left and right with two bright littl twinkl ey like a mous when he ventur out from hi hole it gave me the chill to think of kill him but i thought of the treasur and my heart set as hard as a flint within me when he saw my white face he gave a littl chirrup of joi and came run up toward me your protect sahib he pantedyour protect for the unhappi merchant achmet i have travel across rajpootana that i might seek the shelter of the fort at agra i have been rob and beaten and abus becaus i have been the friend of the compani it is a bless night thi when i am onc more in safetyi and my poor possess what have you in the bundl i ask an iron box he answer which contain on or two littl famili matter which ar of no valu to other but which i should be sorri to lose yet i am not a beggar and i shall reward you young sahib and your governor also if he will give me the shelter i ask i could not trust myself to speak longer with the man the more i look at hi fat frighten face the harder did it seem that we should slai him in cold blood it wa best to get it over take him to the main guard said i the two sikh close in upon him on each side and the giant walk behind while thei march in through the dark gatewai never wa a man so compass round with death i remain at the gatewai with the lantern i could hear the measur tramp of their footstep sound through the lone corridor suddenli it ceas and i heard voic and a scuffl with the sound of blow a moment later there came to my horror a rush of footstep come in my direct with the loud breath of a run man i turn my lantern down the long straight passag and there wa the fat man run like the wind with a smear of blood across hi face and close at hi heel bound like a tiger the great blackbeard sikh with a knife flash in hi hand i have never seen a man run so fast as that littl merchant he wa gain on the sikh and i could see that if he onc pass me and got to the open air he would save himself yet my heart soften to him but again the thought of hi treasur turn me hard and bitter i cast my firelock between hi leg as he race past and he roll twice over like a shot rabbit er he could stagger to hi feet the sikh wa upon him and buri hi knife twice in hi side the man never utter moan nor move muscl but lai were he had fallen i think myself that he mai have broken hi neck with the fall you see gentlemen that i am keep my promis i am tell you everi work of the busi just exactli as it happen whether it is in my favor or not he stop and held out hi manacl hand for the whiskeyandwat which holm had brew for him for myself i confess that i had now conceiv the utmost horror of the man not onli for thi coldblood busi in which he had been concern but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless wai in which he narrat it whatev punish wa in store for him i felt that he might expect no sympathi from me sherlock holm and jone sat with their hand upon their knee deepli interest in the stori but with the same disgust written upon their face he mai have observ it for there wa a touch of defianc in hi voic and manner as he proceed it wa all veri bad no doubt said he i should like to know how mani fellow in my shoe would have refus a share of thi loot when thei knew that thei would have their throat cut for their pain besid it wa my life or hi when onc he wa in the fort if he had got out the whole busi would come to light and i should have been courtmartial and shot as like as not for peopl were not veri lenient at a time like that go on with your stori said holm shortli well we carri him in abdullah akbar and i a fine weight he wa too for all that he wa so short mahomet singh wa left to guard the door we took him to a place which the sikh had alreadi prepar it wa some distanc off where a wind passag lead to a great empti hall the brick wall of which were all crumbl to piec the earth floor had sunk in at on place make a natur grave so we left achmet the merchant there have first cover him over with loos brick thi done we all went back to the treasur it lai where he had drop it when he wa first attack the box wa the same which now li open upon your tabl a kei wa hung by a silken cord to that carv handl upon the top we open it and the light of the lantern gleam upon a collect of gem such as i have read of and thought about when i wa a littl lad at pershor it wa blind to look upon them when we had feast our ey we took them all out and made a list of them there were on hundr and fortythre diamond of the first water includ on which ha been call i believ the great mogul and is said to be the second largest stone in exist then there were ninetyseven veri fine emerald and on hundr and seventi rubi some of which howev were small there were forti carbuncl two hundr and ten sapphir sixtyon agat and a great quantiti of beryl onyx catsey turquois and other stone the veri name of which i did not know at the time though i have becom more familiar with them sinc besid thi there were nearli three hundr veri fine pearl twelv of which were set in a gold coronet by the wai these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when i recov it after we had count our treasur we put them back into the chest and carri them to the gatewai to show them to mahomet singh then we solemnli renew our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret we agre to conceal our loot in a safe place until the countri should be at peac again and then to divid it equal among ourselv there wa no us divid it at present for if gem of such valu were found upon us it would caus suspicion and there wa no privaci in the fort nor ani place where we could keep them we carri the box therefor into the same hall where we had buri the bodi and there under certain brick in the bestpreserv wall we made a hollow and put our treasur we made care note of the place and next dai i drew four plan on for each of us and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom for we had sworn that we should each alwai act for all so that none might take advantag that is an oath that i can put my hand to my heart and swear that i have never broken well there no us my tell you gentlemen what came of the indian mutini after wilson took delhi and sir colin reliev lucknow the back of the busi wa broken fresh troop came pour in and nana sahib made himself scarc over the frontier a fly column under colonel greath came round to agra and clear the pandi awai from it peac seem to be settl upon the countri and we four were begin to hope that the time wa at hand when we might safe go off with our share of the plunder in a moment howev our hope were shatter by our be arrest as the murder of achmet it came about in thi wai when the rajah put hi jewel into the hand of achmet he did it becaus he knew that he wa a trusti man thei ar suspici folk in the east howev so what doe thi rajah do but take a second even more trusti servant and set him to plai the spy upon the first thi second man wa order never to let achmet out of hi sight and he follow him like hi shadow he went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorwai of cours he thought he had taken refug in the fort and appli for admiss there himself next dai but could find no trace of achmet thi seem to him so strang that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guid who brought it to the ear of the command a thorough search wa quickli made and the bodi wa discov thu at the veri moment that we thought that all wa safe we were all four seiz and brought to trial on a charg of murderthre of us becaus we had held the gate that night and the fourth becaus he wa known to have been in the compani of the murder man not a word about the jewel came out at the trial for the rajah had been depos and driven out of india so no on had ani particular interest in them the murder howev wa clearli made out and it wa certain that we must all have been concern in it the three sikh got penal servitud for life and i wa condemn to death though my sentenc wa afterward commut into the same as the other it wa rather a queer posit that we found ourselv in then there we were all four ti by the leg and with preciou littl chanc of ever get out again while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palac if we could onli have made us of it it wa enough to make a man eat hi heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of everi petti jackinoffic to have rice to eat and water to drink when that gorgeou fortun wa readi for him outsid just wait to be pick up it might have driven me mad but i wa alwai a pretti stubborn on so i just held on and bide my time at last it seem to me to have come i wa chang from agra to madra and from there to blair island in the andaman there ar veri few white convict at thi settlement and as i had behav well from the first i soon found myself a sort of privileg person i wa given a hut in hope town which is a small place on the slope of mount harriet and i wa left pretti much to myself it is a dreari feverstricken place and all beyond our littl clear wa infest with wild cannib nativ who were readi enough to blow a poison dart at us if thei saw a chanc there wa dig and ditch and yamplant and a dozen other thing to be done so we were busi enough all dai though in the even we had a littl time to ourselv among other thing i learn to dispens drug for the surgeon and pick up a smatter of hi knowledg all the time i wa on the lookout for a chanc of escap but it is hundr of mile from ani other land and there is littl or no wind in those sea so it wa a terribl difficult job to get awai the surgeon dr somerton wa a fast sport young chap and the other young offic would meet in hi room of an even and plai card the surgeri where i us to make up my drug wa next to hi sittingroom with a small window between us often if i felt lonesom i us to turn out the lamp in the surgeri and then stand there i could hear their talk and watch their plai i am fond of a hand at card myself and it wa almost as good as have on to watch the other there wa major sholto captain morstan and lieuten bromlei brown who were in command of the nativ troop and there wa the surgeon himself and two or three prisonoffici crafti old hand who plai a nice sly safe game a veri snug littl parti thei us to make well there wa on thing which veri soon struck me and that wa that the soldier us alwai to lose and the civilian to win mind i dont sai that there wa anyth unfair but so it wa these prisonchap had done littl els than plai card ever sinc thei had been at the andaman and thei knew each other game to a point while the other just plai to pass the time and threw their card down anyhow night after night the soldier got up poorer men and the poorer thei got the more keen thei were to plai major sholto wa the hardest hit he us to pai in note and gold at first but soon it came to note of hand and for big sum he sometim would win for a few deal just to give him heart and then the luck would set in against him wors than ever all dai he would wander about as black as thunder and he took to drink a deal more than wa good for him on night he lost even more heavili than usual i wa sit in my hut when he and captain morstan came stumbl along on the wai to their quarter thei were bosom friend those two and never far apart the major wa rave about hi loss it all up morstan he wa sai as thei pass my hut i shall have to send in my paper i am a ruin man nonsens old chap said the other slap him upon the shoulder iv had a nasti facer myself but that wa all i could hear but it wa enough to set me think a coupl of dai later major sholto wa stroll on the beach so i took the chanc of speak to him i wish to have your advic major said i well small what is it he ask take hi cheroot from hi lip i want to ask you sir said i who is the proper person to whom hidden treasur should be hand over i know where half a million worth li and as i cannot us it myself i thought perhap the best thing that i could do would be to hand it over to the proper author and then perhap thei would get my sentenc shorten for me half a million small he gasp look hard at me to see if i wa in earnest quit that sirin jewel and pearl it li there readi for ani on and the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlaw and cannot hold properti so that it belong to the first comer to govern small he stammeredto govern but he said it in a halt fashion and i knew in my heart that i had got him you think then sir that i should give the inform to the governorgener said i quietli well well you must not do anyth rash or that you might repent let me hear all about it small give me the fact i told him the whole stori with small chang so that he could not identifi the place when i had finish he stood stock still and full of thought i could see by the twitch of hi lip that there wa a struggl go on within him thi is a veri import matter small he said at last you must not sai a word to ani on about it and i shall see you again soon two night later he and hi friend captain morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern i want you just to let captain morstan hear that stori from your own lip small said he i repeat it as i had told it befor it ring true eh said he it good enough to act upon captain morstan nod look here small said the major we have been talk it over my friend here and i and we have come to the conclus that thi secret of your is hardli a govern matter after all but is a privat concern of your own which of cours you have the power of dispos of as you think best now the question is what price would you ask for it we might be inclin to take it up and at least look into it if we could agre as to term he tri to speak in a cool careless wai but hi ey were shine with excit and greed why as to that gentlemen i answer try also to be cool but feel as

indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain if there were onli on he said none or all i answer we have sworn it the four of us must alwai act togeth you see morstan said he small is a man of hi word he doe not flinch from hi friend i think we mai veri well trust him it a dirti busi the other answer yet as you sai the monei would save our commiss handsom well small said the major we

my littl chum and i went through you would not thank me for i would have you here until the sun wa shine here and there we drift about the world someth alwai turn up to keep us from london all the time howev i never lost sight of my purpos i would dream of sholto at night a hundr time i have kill him in my sleep at last howev some three or four year ago we found ourselv in england i had no great difficulti in find where sholto live and i set to work to discov whether he had realiz the treasur or if he still had it i made friend with someon who could help mei name no name for i dont want to get ani on els in a holeand i soon found that he still had the jewel then i tri to get at him in mani wai but he wa pretti sly and had alwai two prizefight besid hi son and hi khitmutgar on guard over him on dai howev i got word that he wa dy i hurri at onc to the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutch like that and look through the window i saw him ly in hi bed with hi son on each side of him id have come through and taken my chanc with the three of them onli even as i look at him hi jaw drop and i knew that he wa gone i got into hi room that same night though and i search hi paper to see if there wa ani record of where he had hidden our jewel there wa not a line howev so i came awai bitter and savag as a man could be befor i left i bethought me that if i ever met my sikh friend again it would be a satisfact to know that i had left some mark of our hatr so i scrawl down the sign of the four of us as it had been on the chart and i pin it on hi bosom it wa too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had rob and befool we earn a live at thi time by my exhibit poor tonga at fair and other such place as the black cannib he would eat raw meat and danc hi wardanc so we alwai had a hat of penni after a dai work i still heard all the new from pondicherri lodg and for some year there wa no new to hear except that thei were hunt for the treasur at last howev came what we had wait for so long the treasur had been found it wa up at the top of the hous in mr bartholomew sholto chemic laboratori i came at onc and had a look at the place but i could not see how with my wooden leg i wa to make my wai up to it i learn howev about a trapdoor in the roof and also about mr sholto supperhour it seem to me that i could manag the thing easili through tonga i brought him out with me with a long rope wound round hi waist he could climb like a cat and he soon made hi wai through the roof but as ill luck would have it bartholomew sholto wa still in the room to hi cost tonga thought he had done someth veri clever in kill him for when i came up by the rope i found him strut about as proud as a peacock veri much surpris wa he when i made at him with the rope end and curs him for a littl bloodthirsti imp i took the treasurebox and let it down and then slid down myself have first left the sign of the four upon the tabl to show that the jewel had come back at last to those who had most right to them tonga then pull up the rope close the window and made off the wai that he had come i dont know that i have anyth els to tell you i had heard a waterman speak of the speed of smith launch the aurora so i thought she would be a handi craft for our escap i engag with old smith and wa to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship he knew no doubt that there wa some screw loos but he wa not in our secret all thi is the truth and if i tell it to you gentlemen it is not to amus youfor you have not done me a veri good turnbut it is becaus i believ the best defenc i can make is just to hold back noth but let all the world know how badli i have myself been serv by major sholto and how innoc i am of the death of hi son a veri remark account said sherlock holm a fit windup to an extrem interest case there is noth at all new to me in the latter part of your narr except that you brought your own rope that i did
