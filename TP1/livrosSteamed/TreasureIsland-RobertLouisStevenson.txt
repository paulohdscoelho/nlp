of grace and go back to the time when my father kept the admir benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabr cut first took up hi lodg under our roof i rememb him as if it were yesterdai as he came plod to the inn door hi seachest follow behind him in a handbarrowa tall strong heavi nutbrown man hi tarri pigtail fall over the shoulder of hi soil blue coat hi hand rag and scar with black broken nail and the sabr cut across on cheek a dirti livid white i rememb him look round the cover and whistl to himself as he did so and then break out in that old seasong that he sang so often afterward fifteen men on the dead man chest yohoho and a bottl of rum in the high old totter voic that seem to have been tune and broken at the capstan bar then he rap on the door with a bit of stick like a handspik that he carri and when my father appear call roughli for a glass of rum thi when it wa brought to him he drank slowli like a connoisseur linger on the tast and still look about him at the cliff and up at our signboard thi is a handi cove sai he at length and a pleasant sittyat grogshop much compani mate my father told him no veri littl compani the more wa the piti well then said he thi is the berth for me here you matei he cri to the man who trundl the barrow bring up alongsid and help up my chest ill stai here a bit he continu im a plain man rum and bacon and egg is what i want and that head up there for to watch ship off what you mought call me you mought call me captain oh i see what your atther and he threw down three or four gold piec on the threshold you can tell me when iv work through that sai he look as fierc as a command and inde bad as hi cloth were and coars as he spoke he had none of the appear of a man who sail befor the mast but seem like a mate or skipper accustom to be obei or to strike the man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morn befor at the royal georg that he had inquir what inn there were along the coast and hear our well spoken of i suppos and describ as lone had chosen it from the other for hi place of resid and that wa all we could learn of our guest he wa a veri silent man by custom all dai he hung round the cove or upon the cliff with a brass telescop all even he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water veri strong mostli he would not speak when spoken to onli look up sudden and fierc and blow through hi nose like a foghorn and we and the peopl who came about our hous soon learn to let him be everi dai when he came back from hi stroll he would ask if ani seafar men had gone by along the road at first we thought it wa the want of compani of hi own kind that made him ask thi question but at last we began to see he wa desir to avoid them when a seaman did put up at the admir benbow as now and then some did make by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the curtain door befor he enter the parlour and he wa alwai sure to be as silent as a mous when ani such wa present for me at least there wa no secret about the matter for i wa in a wai a sharer in hi alarm he had taken me asid on dai and promis me a silver fourpenni on the first of everi month if i would onli keep my weatherey open for a seafar man with on leg and let him know the moment he appear often enough when the first of the month came round and i appli to him for my wage he would onli blow through hi nose at me and stare me down but befor the week wa out he wa sure to think better of it bring me my fourpenni piec and repeat hi order to look out for the seafar man with on leg how that personag haunt my dream i need scarc tell you on stormi night when the wind shook the four corner of the hous and the surf roar along the cove and up the cliff i would see him in a thousand form and with a thousand diabol express now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he wa a monstrou kind of a creatur who had never had but the on leg and that in the middl of hi bodi to see him leap and run and pursu me over hedg and ditch wa the worst of nightmar and altogeth i paid pretti dear for my monthli fourpenni piec in the shape of these abomin fanci but though i wa so terrifi by the idea of the seafar man with on leg i wa far less afraid of the captain himself than anybodi els who knew him there were night when he took a deal more rum and water than hi head would carri and then he would sometim sit and sing hi wick old wild seasong mind nobodi but sometim he would call for glass round and forc all the trembl compani to listen to hi stori or bear a choru to hi sing often i have heard the hous shake with yohoho and a bottl of rum all the neighbour join in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each sing louder than the other to avoid remark for in these fit he wa the most overrid companion ever known he would slap hi hand on the tabl for silenc all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometim becaus none wa put and so he judg the compani wa not follow hi stori nor would he allow anyon to leav the inn till he had drunk himself sleepi and reel off to bed hi stori were what frighten peopl worst of all dread stori thei wereabout hang and walk the plank and storm at sea and the dry tortuga and wild deed and place on the spanish main by hi own account he must have live hi life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allow upon the sea and the languag in which he told these stori shock our plain countri peopl almost as much as the crime that he describ my father wa alwai sai the inn would be ruin for peopl would soon ceas come there to be tyrann over and put down and sent shiver to their bed but i realli believ hi presenc did us good peopl were frighten at the time but on look back thei rather like it it wa a fine excit in a quiet countri life and there wa even a parti of the younger men who pretend to admir him call him a true seadog and a real old salt and such like name and sai there wa the sort of man that made england terribl at sea in on wai inde he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on stai week after week and at last month after month so that all the monei had been long exhaust and still my father never pluck up the heart to insist on have more if ever he mention it the captain blew through hi nose so loudli that you might sai he roar and stare my poor father out of the room i have seen him wring hi hand after such a rebuff and i am sure the annoy and the terror he live in must have greatli hasten hi earli and unhappi death all the time he live with us the captain made no chang whatev in hi dress but to bui some stock from a hawker on of the cock of hi hat have fallen down he let it hang from that dai forth though it wa a great annoy when it blew i rememb the appear of hi coat which he patch himself upstair in hi room and which befor the end wa noth but patch he never wrote or receiv a letter and he never spoke with ani but the neighbour and with these for the most part onli when drunk on rum the great seachest none of us had ever seen open he wa onli onc cross and that wa toward the end when my poor father wa far gone in a declin that took him off dr livesei came late on afternoon to see the patient took a bit of dinner from my mother and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until hi hors should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabl at the old benbow i follow him in and i rememb observ the contrast the neat bright doctor with hi powder as white as snow and hi bright black ey and pleasant manner made with the coltish countri folk and abov all with that filthi heavi blear scarecrow of a pirat of our sit far gone in rum with hi arm on the tabl suddenli heth captain that isbegan to pipe up hi etern song fifteen men on the dead man chest yohoho and a bottl of rum drink and the devil had done for the rest yohoho and a bottl of rum at first i had suppos the dead man chest to be that ident big box of hi upstair in the front room and the thought had been mingl in my nightmar with that of the oneleg seafar man but by thi time we had all long ceas to pai ani particular notic to the song it wa new that night to nobodi but dr livesei and on him i observ it did not produc an agreeabl effect for he look up for a moment quit angrili befor he went on with hi talk to old taylor the garden on a new cure for the rheumat in the meantim the captain gradual brighten up at hi own music and at last flap hi hand upon the tabl befor him in a wai we all knew to mean silenc the voic stop at onc all but dr livesei he went on as befor speak clear and kind and draw briskli at hi pipe between everi word or two the captain glare at him for a while flap hi hand again glare still harder and at last broke out with a villain low oath silenc there between deck were you address me sir sai the doctor and when the ruffian had told him with anoth oath that thi wa so i have onli on thing to sai to you sir repli the doctor that if you keep on drink rum the world will soon be quit of a veri dirti scoundrel the old fellow furi wa aw he sprang to hi feet drew and open a sailor claspknif and balanc it open on the palm of hi hand threaten to pin the doctor to the wall the doctor never so much as move he spoke to him as befor over hi shoulder and in the same tone of voic rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectli calm and steadi if you do not put that knife thi instant in your pocket i promis upon my honour you shall hang at the next assiz then follow a battl of look between them but the captain soon knuckl under put up hi weapon and resum hi seat grumbl like a beaten dog and now sir continu the doctor sinc i now know there such a fellow in my district you mai count ill have an ey upon you dai and night im not a doctor onli im a magistr and if i catch a breath of complaint against you if it onli for a piec of incivil like tonight ill take effectu mean to have you hunt down and rout out of thi let that suffic soon after dr livesei hors came to the door and he rode awai but the captain held hi peac that even and for mani even to come black dog appear and disappear it wa not veri long after thi that there occur the first of the mysteri event that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of hi affair it wa a bitter cold winter with long hard frost and heavi gale and it wa plain from the first

father di quit suddenli that even which put all other matter on on side our natur distress the visit of the neighbour the arrang of the funer and all the work of the inn to be carri on in the meanwhil kept me so busi that i had scarc time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him he got downstair next morn to be sure and had hi meal as usual though he at littl and had more i am afraid than hi usual suppli of rum for he help himself out of the bar scowl and blow through hi nose and no on dare to cross him on the night befor the funer he wa as drunk as ever and it wa shock in that hous of mourn to hear him sing awai at hi ugli old seasong but weak as he wa we were all in the fear of death for him and the doctor wa suddenli taken up with a case mani mile awai and wa never near the hous after my father death i have said the captain wa weak and inde he seem rather to grow weaker than regain hi strength he clamber up and down stair and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometim put hi nose out of door to smell the sea hold on to the wall as he went for support and breath hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain he never particularli address me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten hi confid but hi temper wa more flighti and allow for hi bodili weak more violent than ever he had an alarm wai now when he wa drunk of draw hi cutlass and lai it bare befor him on the tabl but with all that he mind peopl less and seem shut up in hi own thought and rather wander onc for instanc to our extrem wonder he pipe up to a differ air a kind of countri lovesong that he must have learn in hi youth befor he had begun to follow the sea so thing pass until the dai after the funer and about three oclock of a bitter foggi frosti afternoon i wa stand at the door for a moment full of sad thought about my father when i saw someon draw slowli near along the road he wa plainli blind for he tap befor him with a stick and wore a great green shade over hi ey and nose and he wa hunch as if with ag or weak and wore a huge old tatter seacloak with a hood that made him appear posit deform i never saw in my life a more dreadfullook figur he stop a littl from the inn and rais hi voic in an odd singsong address the air in front of him will ani kind friend inform a poor blind man who ha lost the preciou sight of hi ey in the graciou defenc of hi nativ countri englandand god bless king georgewher or in what part of thi countri he mai now be you ar at the admir benbow black hill cove my good man said i i hear a voic said he a young voic will you give me your hand my kind young friend and lead me in i held out my hand and the horribl softspoken eyeless creatur grip it in a moment like a vise i wa so much startl that i struggl to withdraw but the blind man pull me close up to him with a singl action of hi arm now boi he said take me in to the captain sir said i upon my word i dare not oh he sneer that it take me in straight or ill break your arm and he gave it as he spoke a wrench that made me cry out sir said i it is for yourself i mean the captain is not what he us to be he sit with a drawn cutlass anoth gentleman come now march interrupt he and i never heard a voic so cruel and cold and ugli as that blind man it cow me more than the pain and i began to obei him at onc walk straight in at the door and toward the parlour where our sick old buccan wa sit daze with rum the blind man clung close to me hold me in on iron fist and lean almost more of hi weight on me than i could carri lead me straight up to him and when im in view cry out here a friend for you bill if you dont ill do thi and with that he gave me a twitch that i thought would have made me faint between thi and that i wa so utterli terrifi of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain and as i open the parlour door cri out the word he had order in a trembl voic the poor captain rais hi ey and at on look the rum went out of him and left him stare sober the express of hi face wa not so much of terror as of mortal sick he made a movement to rise but i do not believ he had enough forc left in hi bodi now bill sit where you ar said the beggar if i cant see i can hear a finger stir busi is busi hold out your left hand boi take hi left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right we both obei him to the letter and i saw him pass someth from the hollow of the hand that held hi stick into the palm of the captain which close upon it instantli and now that done said the blind man and at the word he suddenli left hold of me and with incred accuraci and nimbl skip out of the parlour and into the road where as i still stood motionless i could hear hi stick go taptaptap into the distanc it wa some time befor either i or the captain seem to gather our sens but at length and about at the same moment i releas hi wrist which i wa still hold and he drew in hi hand and look sharpli into the palm ten oclock he cri six hour well do them yet and he sprang to hi feet even as he did so he reel put hi hand to hi throat stood swai for a moment and then with a peculiar sound fell from hi whole height face foremost to the floor i ran to him at onc call to my mother but hast wa all in vain the captain had been struck dead by thunder apoplexi it is a curiou thing to understand for i had certainli never like the man though of late i had begun to piti him but as soon as i saw that he wa dead i burst into a flood of tear it wa the second death i had known and the sorrow of the first wa still fresh in my heart the seachest i lost no time of cours in tell my mother all that i knew and perhap should have told her long befor and we saw ourselv at onc in a difficult and danger posit some of the man moneyif he had anywa certainli due to us but it wa not like that our captain shipmat abov all the two specimen seen by me black dog and the blind beggar would be inclin to give up their booti in payment of the dead man debt the captain order to mount at onc and ride for doctor livesei would have left my mother alon and unprotect which wa not to be thought of inde it seem imposs for either of us to remain much longer in the hous the fall of coal in the kitchen grate the veri tick of the clock fill us with alarm the neighbourhood to our ear seem haunt by approach footstep and what between the dead bodi of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detest blind beggar hover near at hand and readi to return there were moment when as the sai goe i jump in my skin for terror someth must speedili be resolv upon and it occur to us at last to go forth togeth and seek help in the neighbour hamlet no sooner said than done barehead as we were we ran out at onc in the gather even and the frosti fog the hamlet lai not mani hundr yard awai though out of view on the other side of the next cove and what greatli encourag me it wa in an opposit direct from that whenc the blind man had made hi appear and whither he had presum return we were not mani minut on the road though we sometim stop to lai hold of each other and hearken but there wa no unusu soundnoth but the low wash of the rippl and the croak of the inmat of the wood it wa alreadi candlelight when we reach the hamlet and i shall never forget how much i wa cheer to see the yellow shine in door and window but that as it prove wa the best of the help we were like to get in that quarter foryou would have thought men would have been asham of themselvesno soul would consent to return with us to the admir benbow the more we told of our troubl the moreman woman and childthei clung to the shelter of their hous the name of captain flint though it wa strang to me wa well enough known to some there and carri a great weight of terror some of the men who had been to fieldwork on the far side of the admir benbow rememb besid to have seen sever stranger on the road and take them to be smuggler to have bolt awai and on at least had seen a littl lugger in what we call kitt hole for that matter anyon who wa a comrad of the captain wa enough to frighten them to death and the short and the long of the matter wa that while we could get sever who were will enough to ride to dr livesei which lai in anoth direct not on would help us to defend the inn thei sai cowardic is infecti but then argument is on the other hand a great embolden and so when each had said hi sai my mother made them a speech she would not she declar lose monei that belong to her fatherless boi if none of the rest of you dare she said jim and i dare back we will go the wai we came and small thank to you big hulk chickenheart men well have that chest open if we die for it and ill thank you for that bag mr crosslei to bring back our law monei in of cours i said i would go with my mother and of cours thei all cri out at our foolhardi but even then not a man would go along with us all thei would do wa to give me a load pistol lest we were attack and to promis to have hors readi saddl in case we were pursu on our return while on lad wa to ride forward to the doctor in search of arm assist my heart wa beat fine when we two set forth in the cold night upon thi danger ventur a full moon wa begin to rise and peer redli through the upper edg of the fog and thi increas our hast for it wa plain befor we came forth again that all would be as bright as dai and our departur expos to the ey of ani watcher we slip along the hedg noiseless and swift nor did we see or hear anyth to increas our terror till to our relief the door of the admir benbow had close behind us i slip the bolt at onc and we stood and pant for a moment in the dark alon in the hous with the dead captain bodi then my mother got a candl in the bar and hold each other hand we advanc into the parlour he lai as we had left him on hi back with hi ey open and on arm stretch out draw down the blind jim whisper my mother thei might come and watch outsid and now said she when i had done so we have to get the kei off that and who to touch it i should like to know and she gave a kind of sob as she said the word i went down on my knee at onc on the floor close to hi hand there

about halfwai through i suddenli put my hand upon her arm for i had heard in the silent frosti air a sound that brought my heart into my mouthth taptap of the blind man stick upon the frozen road it drew nearer and nearer while we sat hold our breath then it struck sharp on the inn door and then we could hear the handl be turn and the bolt rattl as the wretch be tri to enter and then there wa a long time of silenc both within and without at last the tap recommenc and to our indescrib joi and gratitud di slowli awai again until it ceas to be heard mother said i take the whole and let be go for i wa sure the bolt door must have seem suspici and would bring the whole hornet nest about our ear though how thank i wa that i had bolt it none could tell who had never met that terribl blind man

could see i cant speak as to that sir not have seen her tri said the captain she seem a clever craft more i cant sai possibl sir you mai not like your employ either sai the squir but here dr livesei cut in stai a bit said he stai a bit no us of such question as that but to produc ill feel the captain ha said too much or he ha said too littl and im bound to sai that i requir an explan of hi word you dont you sai like thi cruis now why i wa engag sir on what we call seal order to sail thi ship for that gentleman where he should bid me said the captain so far so good but now i find that everi

ticklish work i dont like treasur voyag on ani account and i dont like them abov all when thei ar secret and when beg your pardon mr trelawnei the secret ha been told to the parrot silver parrot ask the squir it a wai of speak said the captain blab i mean it my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you ar about but ill tell you my wai of itlif or death and a close run that is all clear and i dare sai true enough repli dr livesei we take the risk but we ar not so ignor as you believ us next you sai you dont like the crew ar thei not good seamen i dont like them sir return captain smollett and i think i should have had the choos of my own hand if you go to that perhap you should repli the doctor my friend should perhap have taken you along with him but the slight if there be on wa unintent and you dont like mr arrow i dont sir i believ he a good seaman but he too free with the crew to be a good offic a mate should keep himself to himselfshouldnt drink with the men befor the mast do you mean he drink cri the squir no sir repli the captain onli that he too familiar well now and the short and long of it captain ask the doctor tell us what you want well gentlemen ar you determin to go on thi cruis like iron answer the squir veri good said the captain then as youv heard me veri patient sai thing that i could not prove hear me a few word more thei ar put the powder and the arm in the fore hold now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them therefirst point then you ar bring four of your own peopl with you and thei tell me some of them ar to be berth forward why not give them the berth here besid the cabinsecond point ani more ask mr trelawnei on more said the captain there been too much blab alreadi far too much agre the doctor ill tell you what iv heard myself continu captain smollett that you have a map of an island that there cross on the map to show where treasur is and that the island li and then he name the latitud and longitud exactli i never told that cri the squir to a soul the hand know it sir return the captain livesei that must have been you or hawkin cri the squir it doesnt much matter who it wa repli the doctor and i could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr trelawnei protest neither did i to be sure he wa so loos a talker yet in thi case i believ he wa realli right and that nobodi had told the situat of the island well gentlemen continu the captain i dont know who ha thi map but i make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and mr arrow otherwis i would ask you to let me resign i see said the doctor you wish us to keep thi matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship man with my friend own peopl and provid with all the arm and powder on board in other word you fear a mutini sir said captain smollett with no intent to take offenc i deni your right to put word into my mouth no captain sir would be justifi in go to sea at all if he had ground enough to sai that as for mr arrow i believ him thoroughli honest some of the men ar the same all mai be for what i know but i am respons for the ship safeti and the life of everi man jack aboard of her i see thing go as i think not quit right and i ask you to take certain precaut or let me resign my berth and that all captain smollett began the doctor with a smile did ever you hear the fabl of the mountain and the mous youll excus me i dare sai but you remind me of that fabl when you came in here ill stake my wig you meant more than thi doctor said the captain you ar smart when i came in here i meant to get discharg i had no thought that mr trelawnei would hear a word no more i would cri the squir had livesei not been here i should have seen you to the deuc as it is i have heard you i will do as you desir but i think the wors of you that as you pleas sir said the captain youll find i do my duti and with that he took hi leav trelawnei said the doctor contrari to all my notion i believ you have manag to get two honest men on board with youthat man and john silver silver if you like cri the squir but as for that intoler humbug i declar i think hi conduct unmanli unsailorli and downright unenglish well sai the doctor we shall see when we came on deck the men had begun alreadi to take out the arm and powder yoho at their work while the captain and mr arrow stood by superintend the new arrang wa quit to my like the whole schooner had been overhaul six berth had been made astern out of what had been the afterpart of the main hold and thi set of cabin wa onli join to the gallei and forecastl by a spar passag on the port side it had been origin meant that the captain mr arrow hunter joyc the doctor and the squir were to occupi these six berth now redruth and i were to get two of them and mr arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion which had been enlarg on each side till you might almost have call it a roundhous veri low it wa still of cours but there wa room to swing two hammock and even the mate seem pleas with the arrang even he perhap had been doubt as to the crew but that is onli guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of hi opinion we were all hard at work chang the powder and the berth when the last man or two and long john along with them came off in a shoreboat the cook came up the side like a monkei for clever and as soon as he saw what wa do so ho mate sai he what thi were achang of the powder jack answer on why by the power cri long john if we do well miss the morn tide my order said the captain shortli you mai go below my man hand will want supper ay ay sir answer the cook and touch hi forelock he disappear at onc in the direct of hi gallei that a good man captain said the doctor veri like sir repli captain smollett easi with that meneasi he ran on to the fellow who were shift the powder and then suddenli observ me examin the swivel we carri amidship a long brass nine here you ship boi he cri out o that off with you to the cook and get some work and then as i wa hurri off i heard him sai quit loudli to the doctor ill have no favourit on my ship i assur you i wa quit of the squir wai of think and hate the captain deepli the voyag all that night we were in a great bustl get thing stow in their place and boat of the squir friend mr blandli and the like come off to wish him a good voyag and a safe return we never had a night at the admir benbow when i had half the work and i wa dogtir when a littl befor dawn the boatswain sound hi pipe and the crew began to man the capstanbar i might have been twice as weari yet i would not have left the deck all wa so new and interest to meth brief command the shrill note of the whistl the men bustl to their place in the glimmer of the ship lantern now barbecu tip us a stave cri on voic the old on cri anoth ay ay mate said long john who wa stand by with hi crutch under hi arm and at onc broke out in the air and word i knew so well fifteen men on the dead man chest and then the whole crew bore choru yohoho and a bottl of rum and at the third ho drove the bar befor them with a will even at that excit moment it carri me back to the old admir benbow in a second and i seem to hear the voic of the captain pipe in the choru but soon the anchor wa short up soon it wa hang drip at the bow soon the sail began to draw and the land and ship to flit by on either side and befor i could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyag to the isl of treasur i am not go to relat that voyag in detail it wa fairli prosper the ship prove to be a good ship the crew were capabl seamen and the captain thoroughli understood hi busi but befor we came the length of treasur island two or three thing had happen which requir to be known mr arrow first of all turn out even wors than the captain had fear he had no command among the men and peopl did what thei pleas with him but that wa by no mean the worst of it for after a dai or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazi ey red cheek stutter tongu and other mark of drunken time after time he wa order below in disgrac sometim he fell and cut himself sometim he lai all dai long in hi littl bunk at on side of the companion sometim for a dai or two he would be almost sober and attend to hi work at least passabl in the meantim we could never make out where he got the drink that wa the ship mysteri watch him as we pleas we could do noth to solv it and when we ask him to hi face he would onli laugh if he were drunk and if he were sober deni solemnli that he ever tast anyth but water he wa not onli useless as an offic and a bad influenc amongst the men but it wa plain that at thi rate he must soon kill himself outright so nobodi wa much surpris nor veri sorri when on dark night with a head sea he disappear entir and wa seen no more overboard said the captain well gentlemen that save the troubl of put him in iron but there we were without a mate and it wa necessari of cours to advanc on of the men the boatswain job anderson wa the likeliest man aboard and though he kept hi old titl he serv in a wai as mate mr trelawnei had follow the sea and hi knowledg made him veri us for he often took a watch himself in easi weather and the coxswain israel hand wa a care wili old experienc seaman who could be trust at a pinch with almost anyth he wa a great confid of long john silver and so the mention of hi name lead me on to speak of our ship cook barbecu as the men call him aboard ship he carri hi crutch by a lanyard round hi neck to have both hand as free as possibl it wa someth to see him wedg the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead and prop against it yield to everi movement of the ship get on with hi cook like someon safe ashor still more strang wa it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck he had a line or two rig up to help him across the widest spaceslong john ear thei were call and he would hand himself from on place to anoth now us the crutch now trail it alongsid by the lanyard as quickli as anoth man could walk yet some of the men who had sail with him befor express their piti to see him so reduc he no common man barbecu said the coxswain to me he had good school in hi young dai and can speak like a book when so mind and bravea lion noth alongsid of long john i seen him grappl four and knock their head togetherhim unarm all the crew respect and even obei him he had a wai of talk to each and do everybodi some particular servic to me he wa unweariedli kind and alwai glad to see me in the gallei which he kept as clean as a new pin the dish hang up burnish and hi parrot in a cage in on corner come awai hawkin he would sai come and have a yarn with john nobodi more welcom than yourself my son sit you down and hear the new here capn flinti call my parrot capn flint after the famou buccaneerher capn flint predict success to our vyag wasnt you capn and the parrot would sai with great rapid piec of eight piec of eight piec of eight till you wonder that it wa not out of breath or till john threw hi handkerchief over the cage now that bird he would sai is mayb two hundr year old hawkinsthei live forev mostli and if anybodi seen more wicked it must be the devil himself she sail with england the great capn england the pirat she been at madagascar and at malabar and surinam and provid and portobello she wa at the fish up of the wreck plate ship it there she learn piec of eight and littl wonder three hundr and fifti thousand of em hawkin she wa at the board of the viceroi of the indi out of goa she wa and to look at her you would think she wa a babbi but you smelt powderdidnt you capn stand by to go about the parrot would scream ah she a handsom craft she is the cook would sai and give her sugar from hi pocket and then the bird would peck at the bar and swear straight on pass belief for wicked there john would add you cant touch pitch and not be muck lad here thi poor old innoc bird o mine swear blue fire and none the wiser you mai lai to that she would swear the same in a manner of speak befor chaplain and john would touch hi forelock with a solemn wai he had that made me think he wa the best of men in the meantim the squir and captain smollett were still on pretti distant term with on anoth the squir made no bone about the matter he despis the captain the captain on hi part never spoke but when he wa spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wast he own when driven into a corner that he seem to have been wrong about the crew that some of them were as brisk as he want to see and all had behav fairli well as for the ship he had taken a downright fanci to her shell lie a point nearer the wind than a man ha a right to expect of hi own marri wife sir but he would add all i sai is were not home again and i dont like the cruis the squir at thi would turn awai and march up and down the deck chin in air a trifl more of that man he would sai and i shall explod we had some heavi weather which onli prove the qualiti of the hispaniola everi man on board seem well content and thei must have been hard to pleas if thei had been otherwis for it is my belief there wa never a ship compani so spoil sinc noah put to sea doubl grog wa go on the least excus there wa duff on odd dai as for instanc if the squir heard it wa ani man birthdai and alwai a barrel of appl stand broach in the waist for anyon to help himself that had a fanci never knew good come of it yet the captain said to dr livesei spoil forecastl hand make devil that my belief but good did come of the appl barrel as you shall hear for if it had not been for that we should have had no note of warn and might all have perish by the hand of treacheri thi wa how it came about we had run up the trade to get the wind of the island we were afteri am not allow to be more plainand now we were run down for it with a bright lookout dai and night it wa about the last dai of our outward voyag by the largest comput some time that night or at latest befor noon of the morrow we should sight the treasur island we were head ssw and had a steadi breez abeam and a quiet sea the hispaniola roll steadili dip her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of sprai all wa draw alow and aloft everyon wa in the bravest spirit becaus we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventur now just after sundown when all my work wa over and i wa on my wai to my berth it occur to me that i should like an appl i ran on deck the watch wa all forward look out for the island the man at the helm wa watch the luff of the sail and whistl awai gentli to himself and that wa the onli sound except the swish of the sea against the bow and around the side of the ship in i got bodili into the appl barrel and found there wa scarc an appl left but sit down there in the dark what with the sound of the water and the rock movement of the ship i had either fallen asleep or wa on the point of do so when a heavi man sat down with rather a clash close by the barrel shook as he lean hi shoulder against it and i wa just about to jump up when the man began to speak it wa silver voic and befor i had heard a dozen word i would not have shown myself for all the world but lai there trembl and listen in the extrem of fear and curios for from these dozen word i understood that the live of all the honest men aboard depend upon me alon what i heard in the appl barrel no not i said silver flint wa capn i wa quartermast along of my timber leg the same broadsid i lost my leg old pew lost hi

you ad the squir i began to feel pretti desper at thi for i felt altogeth helpless and yet by an odd train of circumst it wa inde through me that safeti came in the meantim talk as we pleas there were onli seven out of the twentysix on whom we knew we could reli and out of these seven on wa a boi so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen part threemi shore adventur how my shore adventur began the appear of the island when i came on deck next morn wa altogeth chang although the breez had now utterli ceas we had made a great deal of wai dure the night and were now ly becalm about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast greycolour wood cover a larg part of the surfac thi even tint wa inde broken up by streak of yellow sandbreak in the lower land and by mani tall tree of the pine famili outtop the otherssom singli some in clump but the gener colour wa uniform and sad the hill ran up clear abov the veget in spire of nake rock all were strang shape and the spyglass which wa by three or four hundr feet the tallest on the island wa likewis the strangest in configur run up sheer from almost everi side and then suddenli cut off at the top like a pedest to put a statu on the hispaniola wa roll scupper under in the ocean swell the boom were tear at the block the rudder wa bang to and fro and the whole ship creak groan and jump like a manufactori i had to cling tight to the backstai and the world turn giddili befor my ey for though i wa a good enough sailor when there wa wai on thi stand still and be roll about like a bottl wa a thing i never learn to stand without a qualm or so abov all in the morn on an empti stomach perhap it wa thisperhap it wa the look of the island with it grei melancholi wood and wild stone spire and the surf that we could both see and hear foam and thunder on the steep beachat least although the sun shone bright and hot and the shore bird were fish and cry all around us and you would have thought anyon would have been glad to get to land after be so long at sea my heart sank as the sai is into my boot and from the first look onward i hate the veri thought of treasur island we had a dreari morn work befor us for there wa no sign of ani wind and the boat had to be got out and man and the ship warp three or four mile round the corner of the island and up the narrow passag to the haven behind skeleton island i volunt for on of the boat where i had of cours no busi the heat wa swelter and the men grumbl fierc over their work anderson wa in command of my boat and instead of keep the crew in order he grumbl as loud as the worst well he said with an oath it not forev i thought thi wa a veri bad sign for up to that dai the men had gone briskli and willingli about their busi but the veri sight of the island had relax the cord of disciplin all the wai in long john stood by the steersman and con the ship he knew the passag like the palm of hi hand and though the man in the chain got everywher more water than wa down in the chart john never hesit onc there a strong scour with the ebb he said and thi here passag ha been dug out in a manner of speak with a spade we brought up just where the anchor wa in the chart about a third of a mile from each shore the mainland on on side and skeleton island on the other the bottom wa clean sand the plung of our anchor sent up cloud of bird wheel and cry over the wood but in less than a minut thei were down again and all wa onc more silent the place wa entir landlock buri in wood the tree come right down to highwat mark the shore mostli flat and the hilltop stand round at a distanc in a sort of amphitheatr on here on there two littl river or rather two swamp empti out into thi pond as you might call it and the foliag round that part of the shore had a kind of poison bright from the ship we could see noth of the hous or stockad for thei were quit buri among tree and if it had not been for the chart on the companion we might have been the first that had ever anchor there sinc the island aros out of the sea there wa not a breath of air move nor a sound but that of the surf boom half a mile awai along the beach and against the rock outsid a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchoragea smell of sodden leav and rot tree trunk i observ the doctor snif and snif like someon tast a bad egg i dont know about treasur he said but ill stake my wig there fever here if the conduct of the men had been alarm in the boat it becam truli threaten when thei had come aboard thei lai about the deck growl togeth in talk the slightest order wa receiv with a black look and grudgingli and carelessli obei even the honest hand must have caught the infect for there wa not on man aboard to mend anoth mutini it wa plain hung over us like a thundercloud and it wa not onli we of the cabin parti who perceiv the danger long john wa hard at work go from group to group spend himself in good advic and as for exampl no man could have shown a better he fairli outstrip himself in willing and civil he wa all smile to everyon if an order were given john would be on hi crutch in an instant with the cheeriest ay ay sir in the world and when there wa noth els to do he kept up on song after anoth as if to conceal the discont of the rest of all the gloomi featur of that gloomi afternoon thi obviou anxieti on the part of long john appear the worst we held a council in the cabin sir said the captain if i risk anoth order the whole shipll come about our ear by the run you see sir here it is i get a rough answer do i not well if i speak back pike will be go in two shake if i dont silver will see there someth under that and the game up now weve onli on man to reli on and who is that ask the squir silver sir return the captain he as anxiou as you and i to smother thing up thi is a tiff hed soon talk em out of it if he had the chanc and what i propos to do is to give him the chanc let allow the men an afternoon ashor if thei all go why well fight the ship if thei none of them go well then we hold the cabin and god defend the right if some go you mark my word sir silverl bring em aboard again as mild as lamb it wa so decid load pistol were serv out to all the sure men hunter joyc and redruth were taken into our confid and receiv the new with less surpris and a better spirit than we had look for and then the captain went on deck and address the crew my lad said he weve had a hot dai and ar all tire and out of sort a turn ashorel hurt nobodyth boat ar still in the water you can take the gig and as mani as pleas mai go ashor for the afternoon ill fire a gun half an hour befor sundown i believ the silli fellow must have thought thei would break their shin over treasur as soon as thei were land for thei all came out of their sulk in a moment and gave a cheer that start the echo in a farawai hill and sent the bird onc more fly and squall round the anchorag the captain wa too bright to be in the wai he whip out of sight in a moment leav silver to arrang the parti and i fanci it wa as well he did so had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretend not to understand the situat it wa as plain as dai silver wa the captain and a mighti rebelli crew he had of it the honest handsand i wa soon to see it prove that there were such on boardmust have been veri stupid fellow or rather i suppos the truth wa thi that all hand were disaffect by the exampl of the ringleadersonli some more some less and a few be good fellow in the main could neither be led nor driven ani further it is on thing to be idl and skulk and quit anoth to take a ship and murder a number of innoc men at last howev the parti wa made up six fellow were to stai on board and the remain thirteen includ silver began to embark then it wa that there came into my head the first of the mad notion that contribut so much to save our live if six men were left by silver it wa plain our parti could not take and fight the ship and sinc onli six were left it wa equal plain that the cabin parti had no present need of my assist it occur to me at onc to go ashor in a jiffi i had slip over the side and curl up in the foresheet of the nearest boat and almost at the same moment she shove off no on took notic of me onli the bow oar sai is that you jim keep your head down but silver from the other boat look sharpli over and call out to know if that were me and from that moment i began to regret what i had done the crew race for the beach but the boat i wa in have some start and be at onc the lighter and the better man shot far ahead of her consort and the bow had struck among the shoresid tree and i had caught a branch and swung myself out and plung into the nearest thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundr yard behind jim jim i heard him shout but you mai suppos i paid no heed jump duck and break through i ran straight befor my nose till i could run no longer the first blow i wa so pleas at have given the slip to long john that i began to enjoi myself and look around me with some interest on the strang land that i wa in i had cross a marshi tract full of willow bulrush and odd outlandish swampi tree and i had now come out upon the skirt of an open piec of undul sandi countri about a mile long dot with a few pine and a great number of contort tree not unlik the oak in growth but pale in the foliag like willow on the far side of the open stood on of the hill with two quaint craggi peak shine vividli in the sun i now felt for the first time the joi of explor the isl wa uninhabit my shipmat i had left behind and noth live in front of me but dumb brute and fowl i turn hither and thither among the tree here and there were flower plant unknown to me here and there i saw snake and on rais hi head from a ledg of rock and hiss at me with a nois not unlik the spin of a top littl did i suppos that he wa a deadli enemi and that the nois wa the famou rattl then i came to a long thicket of these oaklik treesliv or evergreen oak i heard afterward thei should be calledwhich grew low along the sand like brambl the bough curious twist the foliag compact like thatch the thicket stretch down from the top of on of the sandi knoll spread and grow taller as it went until it reach the margin of the broad reedi fen through which the nearest of the littl river soak it wai into the anchorag the marsh wa steam in the strong sun and the outlin of the spyglass trembl through the haze all at onc there began to go a sort of bustl among the bulrush a wild duck flew up with a quack anoth follow and soon over the whole surfac of the marsh a great cloud of bird hung scream and circl in the air i judg at onc that some of my shipmat must be draw near along the border of the fen nor wa i deceiv for soon i heard the veri distant and low tone of a human voic which as i continu to give ear grew steadili louder and nearer thi put me in a great fear and i crawl under cover of the nearest liveoak and squat there hearken as silent as a mous anoth voic answer and then the first voic which i now recogn to be silver onc more took up the stori and ran on for a long while in a stream onli now and again interrupt by the other by the sound thei must have been talk earnestli and almost fierc but no distinct word came to my hear at last the speaker seem to have paus and perhap to have sat down for not onli did thei ceas to draw ani nearer but the bird themselv began to grow more quiet and to settl again to their place in the swamp and now i began to feel that i wa neglect my busi that sinc i had been so foolhardi as to come ashor with these desperado the least i could do wa to overhear them at their council and that my plain and obviou duti wa to draw as close as i could manag under the favour ambush of the crouch tree i could tell the direct of the speaker pretti exactli not onli by the sound of their voic but by the behaviour of the few bird that still hung in alarm abov the head of the intrud crawl on all four i made steadili but slowli toward them till at last rais my head to an apertur among the leav i could see clear down into a littl green dell besid the marsh and close set about with tree where long john silver and anoth of the crew stood face to face in convers the sun beat full upon them silver had thrown hi hat besid him on the ground and hi great smooth blond face all shine with heat wa lift to the other man in a kind of appeal mate he wa sai it becaus i think gold dust of yougold dust and you mai lai to that if i hadnt took to you like pitch do you think id have been here awarn of you all upyou cant make nor mend it to save your neck that im aspeak and if on of the wild un knew it where i be tomnow tell me where i be silver said the other manand i observ he wa not onli red in the face but spoke as hoars as a crow and hi voic shook too like a taut ropesilv sai he your old and your honest or ha the name for it and youv monei too which lot of poor sailor hasnt and your brave or im mistook and will you tell me youll let yourself be led awai with that kind of a mess of swab not you as sure as god see me id sooner lose my hand if i turn agin my dooti and then all of a sudden he wa interrupt by a nois i had found on of the honest handswel here at that same moment came new of anoth far awai out in the marsh there aros all of a sudden a sound like the cry of anger then anoth on the back of it and then on horrid longdrawn scream the rock of the spyglass reecho it a score of time the whole troop of marshbird rose again darken heaven with a simultan whirr and long after that death yell wa still ring in my brain silenc had reestablish it empir and onli the rustl of the redescend bird and the boom of the distant surg disturb the languor of the afternoon tom had leap at the sound like a hors at the spur but silver had not wink an ey he stood where he wa rest lightli on hi crutch watch hi companion like a snake about to spring john said the sailor stretch out hi hand hand off cri silver leap back a yard as it seem to me with the speed and secur of a train gymnast hand off if you like john silver said the other it a black conscienc that can make you fear of me but in heaven name tell me what wa that that return silver smile awai but warier than ever hi ey a mere pinpoint in hi big face but gleam like a crumb of glass that oh i reckon thatll be alan and at thi point tom flash out like a hero alan he cri then rest hi soul for a true seaman and as for you john silver long youv been a mate of mine but your mate of mine no more if i die like a dog ill die in my dooti youv kill alan have you kill me too if you can but i defi you and with that thi brave fellow turn hi back directli on the cook and set off walk for the beach but he wa not destin to go far with a cry john seiz the branch of a tree whip the crutch out of hi armpit and sent that uncouth missil hurtl through the air it struck poor tom point foremost and with stun violenc right between the shoulder in the middl of hi back hi hand flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell whether he were injur much or littl none could ever tell like enough to judg from the sound hi back wa broken on the spot but he had no time given him to recov silver agil as a monkei even without leg or crutch wa on the top of him next moment and had twice buri hi knife up to the hilt in that defenceless bodi from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blow i do not know what it rightli is to faint but i do know that for the next littl while the whole world swam awai from befor me in a whirl mist silver and the bird and the tall spyglass hilltop go round and round and topsyturvi befor my ey and all manner of bell ring and distant voic shout in my ear when i came again to myself the monster had pull himself togeth hi crutch under hi arm hi hat upon hi head just befor him tom lai motionless upon the sward but the murder mind him not a whit cleans hi bloodstain knife the while upon a wisp of grass everyth els wa unchang the sun still shine mercilessli on the steam marsh and the tall pinnacl of the mountain and i could scarc persuad myself that murder had been actual done and a human life cruelli cut short a moment sinc befor my ey but now john put hi hand into hi pocket brought out a whistl and blew upon it sever modul blast that rang far across the heat air i could not tell of cours the mean of the signal but it instantli awok my fear more men would be come i might be discov thei had alreadi slain two of the honest peopl after tom and alan might not i come next instantli i began to extric myself and crawl back again with what speed and silenc i could manag to the more open portion of the wood as i did so i could hear hail come and go between the old buccan and hi comrad and thi sound of danger lent me wing as soon as i wa clear of the thicket i ran as i never ran befor scarc mind the direct of my flight so long as it led me from the murder and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turn into a kind of frenzi inde could anyon be more entir lost than i when the gun fire how should i dare to go down to the boat among those fiend still smoke from their crime would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe would not my absenc itself be an evid to them of my alarm and therefor of my fatal knowledg it wa all over i thought goodby to the hispaniola goodby to the squir the doctor and the captain there wa noth left for me but death by starvat or death by the hand of the mutin all thi while as i sai i wa still run and without take ani notic i had drawn near to the foot of the littl hill with the two peak and had got into a part of the island where the liveoak grew more wide apart and seem more like forest tree in their bear and dimens mingl with these were a few scatter pine some fifti some nearer seventi feet high the air too smelt more freshli than down besid the marsh and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstil with a thump heart the man of the island from the side of the hill which wa here steep and stoni a spout of gravel wa dislodg and fell rattl and bound through the tree my ey turn instinct in that direct and i saw a figur leap with great rapid behind the trunk of a pine what it wa whether bear or man or monkei i could in no wise tell it seem dark and shaggi more i knew not but the terror of thi new apparit brought me to a stand i wa now it seem cut off upon both side behind me the murder befor me thi lurk nondescript and immedi i began to prefer the danger that i knew to those i knew not silver himself appear less terribl in contrast with thi creatur of the wood and i turn on my heel and look sharpli behind me over my shoulder began to retrac my step in the direct of the boat instantli the figur reappear and make a wide circuit began to head me off i wa tire at ani rate but had i been as fresh as when i rose i could see it wa in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversari from trunk to trunk the creatur flit like a deer run manlik on two leg but unlik ani man that i had ever seen stoop almost doubl as it ran yet a man it wa i could no longer be in doubt about that i began to recal what i had heard of cannib i wa within an ac of call for help but the mere fact that he wa a man howev wild had somewhat reassur me and my fear of silver began to reviv in

the new that jim hawkin had slip into a boat and wa gone ashor with the rest it never occur to us to doubt jim hawkin but we were alarm for hi safeti with the men in the temper thei were in it seem an even chanc if we should see the lad again we ran on deck the pitch wa bubbl in the seam the nasti stench of the place turn me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysenteri it wa in that abomin anchorag the six scoundrel were sit grumbl under a sail in the forecastl ashor we could see the gig made fast and a man sit in each hard by where the river run in on of them wa whistl lillibullero wait wa a strain and it wa decid that hunter and i should go ashor with the jollyboat in quest of inform the gig had lean to their right but hunter and i pull straight in in the direct of the stockad upon the chart the two who were left guard their boat seem in a bustl at our appear lillibullero stop off and i could see the pair discuss what thei ought to do had thei gone and told silver all might have turn out differ but thei had their order i suppos and decid to sit quietli where thei were and hark back again to lillibullero there wa a slight bend in the coast and i steer so as to put it between us even befor we land we had thu lost sight of the gig i jump out and came as near run as i durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for cool sake and a brace of pistol readi prime for safeti i had not gone a hundr yard when i reach the stockad thi wa how it wa a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll well on the knoll and enclos the spring thei had clap a stout loghous fit to hold two score of peopl on a pinch and loophol for musketri on either side all round thi thei had clear a wide space and then the thing wa complet by a pale six feet high without door or open too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besieg the peopl in the loghous had them in everi wai thei stood quiet in shelter and shot the other like partridg all thei want wa a good watch and food for short of a complet surpris thei might have held the place against a regiment what particularli took my fanci wa the spring for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola with plenti of arm and ammunit and thing to eat and excel wine there had been on thing overlookedw had no water i wa think thi over when there came ring over the island the cry of a man at the point of death i wa not new to violent deathi have serv hi royal high the duke of cumberland and got a wound myself at fontenoybut i know my puls went dot and carri on jim hawkin is gone wa my first thought it is someth to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor there is no time to dillyd in our work and so now i made up my mind instantli and with no time lost return to the shore and jump on board the jollyboat by good fortun hunter pull a good oar we made the water fly and the boat wa soon alongsid and i aboard the schooner i found them all shaken as wa natur the squir wa sit down as white as a sheet think of the harm he had led us to the good soul and on of the six forecastl hand wa littl better there a man sai captain smollett nod toward him new to thi work he came nighhand faint doctor when he heard the cry anoth touch of the rudder and that man would join us i told my plan to the captain and between us we settl on the detail of it accomplish we put old redruth in the galleri between the cabin and the forecastl with three or four load musket and a mattress for protect hunter brought the boat round under the sternport and joyc and i set to work load her with powder tin musket bag of biscuit keg of pork a cask of cognac and my invalu medicin chest in the meantim the squir and the captain stai on deck and the latter hail the coxswain who wa the princip man aboard mr hand he said here ar two of us with a brace of pistol each if ani on of you six make a signal of ani descript that man dead thei were a good deal taken aback and after a littl consult on and all tumbl down the fore companion think no doubt to take us on the rear but when thei saw redruth wait for them in the spar gallei thei went about ship at onc and a head pop out again on deck down dog cri the captain and the head pop back again and we heard no more for the time of these six veri faintheart seamen by thi time tumbl thing in as thei came we had the jollyboat load as much as we dare joyc and i got out through the sternport and we made for shore again as fast as oar could take us thi second trip fairli arous the watcher along shore lillibullero wa drop again and just befor we lost sight of them behind the littl point on of them whip ashor and disappear i had half a mind to chang my plan and destroi their boat but i fear that silver and the other might be close at hand and all might veri well be lost by try for too much we had soon touch land in the same place as befor and set to provis the block hous all three made the first journei heavili laden and toss our store over the palisad then leav joyc to guard themon man to be sure but with half a dozen musketshunt and i return to the jollyboat and load ourselv onc more so we proceed without paus to take breath till the whole cargo wa bestow when the two servant took up their posit in the block hous and i with all my power scull back to the hispaniola that we should have risk a second boat load seem more dare than it realli wa thei had the advantag of number of cours but we had the advantag of arm not on of the men ashor had a musket and befor thei could get within rang for pistol shoot we flatter ourselv we should be abl to give a good account of a halfdozen at least the squir wa wait for me at the stern window all hi faint gone from him he caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to load the boat for our veri live pork powder and biscuit wa the cargo with onli a musket and a cutlass apiec for the squir and me and redruth and the captain the rest of the arm and powder we drop overboard in two fathom and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shine far below us in the sun on the clean sandi bottom by thi time the tide wa begin to ebb and the ship wa swing round to her anchor voic were heard faintli halloa in the direct of the two gig and though thi reassur us for joyc and hunter who were well to the eastward it warn our parti to be off redruth retreat from hi place in the galleri and drop into the boat which we then brought round to the ship counter to be handier for captain smollett now men said he do you hear me there wa no answer from the forecastl it to you abraham grayit to you i am speak still no repli grai resum mr smollett a littl louder i am leav thi ship and i order you to follow your captain i know you ar a good

captain dont hang so long in stai im risk my life and the live of these good gentlemen everi second there wa a sudden scuffl a sound of blow and out burst abraham grai with a knife cut on the side of the cheek and came run to the captain like a dog to the whistl im with you sir said he and the next moment he and the captain had drop aboard of us and we had shove off and given wai we were clear out of the ship but not yet ashor in our stockad narr continu by the doctor the jollyboat last trip thi fifth trip wa quit differ from ani of the other in the first place the littl gallipot of a boat that we were in wa grave overload five grown men and three of themtrelawnei redruth and the captainov six feet high wa alreadi more than she wa meant to carri add to that the powder pork and breadbag the gunwal wa lip astern sever time we ship a littl water and my breech and the tail of my coat were all soak wet befor we had gone a hundr yard the captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a littl more evenli all the same we were afraid to breath in the second place the ebb wa now makinga strong rippl current run westward through the basin and then southard and seaward down the strait by which we had enter in the morn even the rippl were a danger to our overload craft but the worst of it wa that we were swept out of our true cours and awai from our proper landingplac behind the point if we let the current have it wai we should come ashor besid the gig where the pirat might appear at ani moment i cannot keep her head for the stockad sir said i to the captain i wa steer while he and redruth two fresh men were at the oar the tide keep wash her down could you pull a littl stronger not without swamp the boat said he you must bear up sir if you pleasebear up until you see your gain i tri and found by experi that the tide kept sweep us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angl to the wai we ought to go well never get ashor at thi rate said i if it the onli cours that we can lie sir we must even lie it return the captain we must keep upstream you see sir he went on if onc we drop to leeward of the landingplac it hard to sai where we should get ashor besid the chanc of be board by the gig wherea the wai we go the current must slacken and then we can dodg back along the shore the current less areadi sir said the man grai who wa sit in the foresheet you can eas her off a bit thank you my man said i quit as if noth had happen for we had all quietli made up our mind to treat him like on of ourselv suddenli the captain spoke up again and i thought hi voic wa a littl chang the gun said he i have thought of that said i for i made sure he wa think of a bombard of the fort thei could never get the gun ashor and if thei did thei could never haul it through the wood look astern doctor repli the captain we had entir forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogu busi about her get off her jacket as thei call the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sail not onli that but it flash into my mind at the same moment that the roundshot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an ax would put it all into the possess of the evil on abroad israel wa flint gunner said grai hoars at ani risk we put the boat head direct for the landingplac by thi time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerag wai even at our necessarili gentl rate of row and i could keep her steadi for the goal but the worst of it wa that with the cours i now held we turn our broadsid instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offer a target like a barn door i could hear as well as see that brandyfac rascal israel hand plump down a roundshot on the deck who the best shot ask the captain mr trelawnei out and awai said i mr trelawnei will you pleas pick me off on of these men sir hand if possibl said the captain trelawnei wa as cool as steel he look to the prime of hi gun now cri the captain easi with that gun sir or youll swamp the boat all hand stand by to trim her when he aim the squir rais hi gun the row ceas and we lean over to the other side to keep the balanc and all wa so nice contriv that we did not ship a drop thei had the gun by thi time slew round upon the swivel and hand who wa at the muzzl with the rammer wa in consequ the most expos howev we had no luck for just as trelawnei fire down he stoop the ball whistl over him and it wa on of the other four who fell the cry he gave wa echo not onli by hi companion on board but by a great number of voic from the shore and look in that direct i saw the other pirat troop out from among the tree and tumbl into their place in the boat here come the gig sir said i give wai then cri the captain we mustnt mind if we swamp her now if we cant get ashor all up onli on of the gig is be man sir i ad the crew of the other most like go round by shore to cut us off theyll have a hot run sir return the captain jack ashor you know it not them i mind it the roundshot carpet bowl my ladi maid couldnt miss tell us squir when you see the match and well hold water in the meanwhil we had been make headwai at a good pace for a boat so overload and we had ship but littl water in the process we were now close in thirti or forti stroke and we should beach her for the ebb had alreadi disclos a narrow belt of sand below the cluster tree the gig wa no longer to be fear the littl point had alreadi conceal it from our ey the ebbtid which had so cruelli delai us wa now make repar and delai our assail the on sourc of danger wa the gun if i durst said the captain id stop and pick off anoth man but it wa plain that thei meant noth should delai their shot thei had never so much as look at their fallen comrad though he wa not dead and i could see him try to crawl awai readi cri the squir hold cri the captain quick as an echo and he and redruth back with a great heav that sent her stern bodili under water the report fell in at the same instant of time thi wa the first that jim heard the sound of the squir shot not have reach him where the ball pass not on of us precis knew but i fanci it must have been over our head and that the wind of it mai have contribut to our disast at ani rate the boat sank by the stern quit gentli in three feet of water leav the captain and myself face each other on our feet the other three took complet header and came up again drench and bubbl so far there wa no great harm no live were lost and we could wade ashor in safeti but there were all our store at the bottom and to make thing wors onli two gun out of five remain in a state for servic mine i had snatch from my knee and held over my head by a sort of instinct as for the captain he had carri hi over hi shoulder by a bandol and like a wise man lock uppermost the other three had gone down with the boat to add to our concern we heard voic alreadi draw near us in the wood along shore and we had not onli the danger of be cut off from the stockad in our halfcrippl state but the fear befor us whether if hunter and joyc were attack by half a dozen thei would have the sens and conduct to stand firm hunter wa steadi that we knew joyc wa a doubt casea pleasant polit man for a valet and to brush on cloth but not entir fit for a man of war with all thi in our mind we wade ashor as fast as we could leav behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provis narr continu by the doctor end of the first dai fight we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divid us from the stockad and at everi step we took the voic of the buccan rang nearer soon we could hear their footfal as thei ran and the crack of the branch as thei breast across a bit of thicket i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and look to my prime captain said i trelawnei is the dead shot give him your gun hi own is useless thei exchang gun and trelawnei silent and cool as he had been sinc the begin of the bustl hung a moment on hi heel to see that all wa fit for servic at the same time observ grai to be unarm i hand him my cutlass it did all our heart good to see him spit in hi hand knit hi brow and make the blade sing through the air it wa plain from everi line of hi bodi that our new hand wa worth hi salt forti pace farther we came to the edg of the wood and saw the stockad in front of us we struck the enclosur about the middl of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineersjob anderson the boatswain at their headappear in full cry at the southwestern corner thei paus as if taken aback and befor thei recov not onli the squir and i but hunter and joyc from the block hous had time to fire the four shot came in rather a scatter vollei but thei did the busi on of the enemi actual fell and the rest without hesit turn and plung into the tree after reload we walk down the outsid of the palisad to see to the fallen enemi he wa stone deadshot through the heart we began to rejoic over our good success when just at that moment a pistol crack in the bush a ball whistl close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbl and fell hi length on the ground both the squir and i return the shot but as we had noth to aim at it is probabl we onli wast powder then we reload and turn our attent to poor tom the captain and grai were alreadi examin him and i saw with half an ey that all wa over i believ the readi of our return vollei had scatter the mutin onc more for we were suffer without further molest to get the poor old gamekeep hoist over the stockad and carri groan and bleed into the loghous poor

but toward the end of the bombard though still i durst not ventur in the direct of the stockad where the ball fell oftenest i had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shoresid tree the sun had just set the sea breez wa rustl and tumbl in the wood and ruffl the grei surfac of the anchorag the tide too wa far out and great tract of sand lai uncov the air after the heat of the dai chill me through my jacket the hispaniola still lai where she had anchor but sure enough there wa the jolli rogerth black flag of piracyfli from her peak even as i look there came anoth red flash and anoth report that sent the echo clatter and on more roundshot whistl through the air it wa the last of the cannonad i lai for some time watch the bustl which succeed the attack men were demolish someth with ax on the beach near the stockadeth poor jollyboat i afterward discov awai near the mouth of the river a great fire wa glow among the tree and between that point and the ship on of the gig kept come and go the men whom i had seen so gloomi shout at the oar like children but there wa a sound in their voic which suggest rum at length i thought i might return toward the stockad i wa pretti far down on the low sandi spit that enclos the anchorag to the east and is join at halfwat to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distanc further down the spit and rise from among low bush an isol rock pretti high and peculiarli white in colour it occur to me that thi might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some dai or other a boat might be want and i should know where to look for on then i skirt among the wood until i had regain the rear or shoreward side of the stockad and wa soon warmli welcom by the faith parti i had soon told my stori and began to look about me the loghous wa made of unsquar trunk of pineroof wall and floor the latter stood in sever place as much as a foot or a foot and a half abov the surfac of the sand there wa a porch at the door and under thi porch the littl spring well up into an artifici basin of a rather odd kindno other than a great ship kettl of iron with the bottom knock out and sunk to her bear as the captain said among the sand littl had been left besid the framework of the hous but in on corner there wa a stone slab laid down by wai of hearth and an old rusti iron basket to contain the fire the slope of the knoll and all the insid of the stockad had been clear of timber to build the hous and we could see by the stump what a fine and lofti grove had been destroi most of the soil had been wash awai or buri in drift after the remov of the tree onli where the streamlet ran down from the kettl a thick bed of moss and some fern and littl creep bush were still green among the sand veri close around the stockadetoo close for defenc thei saidth wood still flourish high and dens all of fir on the land side but toward the sea with a larg admixtur of liveoak the cold even breez of which i have spoken whistl through everi chink of the rude build and sprinkl the floor with a continu rain of fine sand there wa sand in our ey sand in our teeth sand in our supper sand danc in the spring at the bottom of the kettl for all the world like porridg begin to boil our chimnei wa a squar hole in the roof it wa but a littl part of the smoke that found it wai out and the rest eddi about the hous and kept us cough and pipe the ey add to thi that grai the new man had hi face ti up in a bandag for a cut he had got in break awai from the mutin and that poor old tom redruth still unburi lai along the wall stiff and stark under the union jack if we had been allow to sit idl we should all have fallen in the blue but captain smollett wa never the man for that all hand were call up befor him and he divid us into watch the doctor and grai and i for on the squir hunter and joyc upon the other tire though we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for redruth the doctor wa name cook i wa put sentri at the door and the captain himself went from on to anoth keep up our spirit and lend a hand wherev it wa want from time to time the doctor came to the door for a littl air and to rest hi ey which were almost smoke out of hi head and whenev he did so he had a word for me that man smollett he said onc is a better man than i am and when i sai that it mean a deal jim anoth time he came and wa silent for a while then he put hi head on on side and look at me is thi ben gunn a man he ask i do not know

old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while barehead in the breez a good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captain fanci and he shook hi head over it and told us we must get back to thi tomorrow rather liveli then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandi grog the three chief got togeth in a corner to discuss our prospect it appear thei were at their wit end what to do the store be so low that we must have been starv into surrend long befor help came but our best hope it wa decid wa to kill off the buccan until thei either haul down their flag or ran awai with the hispaniola from nineteen thei were alreadi reduc to fifteen two other were wound and on at leastth man shot besid the gunsever wound if he were not dead everi time we had a crack at them we were to take it save our own live with the extremest care and besid that we had two abl alliesrum and the climat as for the first though we were about half a mile awai we could hear

and west there were onli two loophol on the south side where the porch wa two again and on the north side five there wa a round score of musket for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four pilest you might sayon about the middl of each side and on each of these tabl some ammunit and four load musket were laid readi to the hand of the defend in the middl the cutlass lai rang toss

joyc you stand by the west my man mr trelawnei you ar the best shotyou and grai will take thi long north side with the five loophol it there the danger is if thei can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own port thing would begin to look dirti hawkin neither you nor i ar much account at the shoot well stand by to load and bear a hand as the captain had said the chill wa past as soon as the sun had climb abov our girdl of tree it fell with all it forc upon the clear and drank up the vapour at a draught soon the sand wa bake and the resin melt in the log of the block hous jacket and coat were flung asid shirt thrown open at the neck and roll up to the shoulder and we stood there each at hi post in a fever of heat and anxieti an hour pass awai hang them said the captain thi is as

in a scatter vollei shot behind shot like a string of gees from everi side of the enclosur sever bullet struck the loghous but not on enter and as the smoke clear awai and vanish the stockad and the wood around it look as quiet and empti as befor not a bough wave not the gleam of a musketbarrel betrai the presenc of our foe did you hit your man ask the captain no sir repli joyc i believ not sir next best thing to tell the truth mutter captain smollett load hi gun hawkin how mani should sai there were on your side doctor i know precis said dr livesei three shot were fire on thi side i saw the

comput eight or nine accord to grai from the east and west onli a singl shot had been fire it wa plain therefor that the attack would be develop from the north and that on the other three side we were onli to be annoi by a show of hostil but captain smollett made no chang in hi arrang if the mutin succeed in cross the stockad he argu thei would take possess of ani unprotect loophol and shoot us down like rat in our own stronghold nor had we much time left to us for thought suddenli with a loud huzza a littl cloud of pirat leap from the wood on the north side and ran straight on the stockad at the same moment the fire wa onc more open from the wood and a rifl ball sang through the doorwai and knock the doctor musket into bit the boarder swarm over the fenc like monkei squir and grai fire again and yet again three men fell on forward into the enclosur two back on the outsid but of these on wa evid more frighten than hurt for he wa on hi feet again in a crack and instantli disappear among the tree two had bit the dust on had fled four had made good their foot insid our defenc while from the shelter of the wood seven or eight men each evid suppli with sever musket kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghous the four who had board made straight befor them for the build shout as thei ran and the men among the tree shout back to encourag them sever shot were fire but such wa the hurri of the marksmen that not on appear to have taken effect in a moment the four pirat had swarm up the mound and were upon us the head of job anderson the boatswain appear at the middl loophol at em all handsal hand he roar in a voic of thunder at the same moment anoth pirat grasp hunter musket by the muzzl wrench it from hi hand pluck it through the loophol and with on stun blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor meanwhil a third run unharm all around the hous appear suddenli in the doorwai and fell with hi cutlass on the doctor our posit wa utterli revers a moment sinc we were fire under cover at an expos enemi now it wa we who lai uncov and could not return a blow the loghous wa full of smoke to which we ow our compar safeti cri and confus the flash and report of pistolshot and on loud groan rang in my ear out lad out and fight em in the open cutlass cri the captain i snatch a cutlass from the pile and someon at the same time snatch anoth gave me a cut across the knuckl which i hardli felt i dash out of the door into the clear sunlight someon wa close behind i knew not whom right in front the doctor wa pursu hi assail down the hill and just as my ey fell upon him beat down hi guard and sent him sprawl on hi back with a great slash across the face round the hous lad round the hous cri the captain and even in the hurlyburli i perceiv a chang in hi voic mechan i obei turn eastward and with my cutlass rais ran round the corner of the hous next moment i wa face to face with anderson he roar aloud and hi hanger went up abov hi head flash in the sunlight i had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impend leap in a trice upon on side and miss my foot in the soft sand roll headlong down the slope when i had first salli from the door the other mutin had been alreadi swarm up the palisad to make an end of us on man in a red nightcap with hi cutlass in hi mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across well so short had been the interv that when i found my feet again all wa in the same postur the fellow with the red nightcap still halfwai over anoth still just show hi head abov the top of the stockad and yet in thi breath of time the fight wa over and the victori wa our grai follow close behind me had cut down the big boatswain er he had time to recov from hi last blow anoth had been shot at a loophol in the veri act of fire into the hous and now lai in agoni the pistol still smoke in hi hand a third as i had seen the doctor had dispos of at a blow of the four who had scale the palisad on onli remain unaccount for and he have left hi cutlass on the field wa now clamber out again with the fear of death upon him firefir from the hous cri the doctor and you lad back into cover but hi word were unheed no shot wa fire and the last boarder made good hi escap and disappear with the rest into the wood in three second noth remain of the attack parti but the five who had fallen four on the insid and on on the outsid of the palisad the doctor and grai and i ran full speed for shelter the survivor would soon be back where thei had left their musket and at ani moment the fire might recomm the hous wa by thi time somewhat clear of smoke and we saw at a glanc the price we had paid for victori hunter lai besid hi loophol stun joyc by hi shot through the head never to move again while right in the centr the squir wa support the captain on as pale as the other the captain wound said mr trelawnei have thei run ask mr smollett all that could you mai be bound return the doctor but there five of them will never run again five cri the captain come that better five against three leav us four to nine that better odd than we had at start we were seven to nineteen then or thought we were and that as bad to bear the mutin were soon onli eight in number for the man shot by mr trelawnei on board the schooner di that same even of hi wound but thi wa of cours not known till after by the faith parti part fivemi sea adventur how my sea adventur began there wa no return of the mutineersnot so much as anoth shot out of the wood thei had got their ration for that dai as the captain put it and we had the place to ourselv and a quiet time to overhaul the wound and get dinner squir and i cook outsid in spite of the danger and even outsid we could hardli tell what we were at for horror of the loud groan that reach us from the doctor patient out of the eight men who had fallen in the action onli three still breathedthat on of the pirat who had been shot at the loophol hunter and captain smollett and of these the first two were as good as dead the mutin inde di under the doctor knife and hunter do what we could never recov conscious in thi world he linger all dai breath loudli like the old buccan at home in hi apoplect fit but the bone of hi chest had been crush by the blow and hi skull fractur in fall and some time in the follow night without sign or sound he went to hi maker as for the captain hi wound were grievou inde but not danger no organ wa fatal injur anderson ballfor it wa job that shot him firsthad broken hi shoulderblad and touch the lung not badli the second had onli torn and displac some muscl in the calf he wa sure to recov the doctor said but in the meantim and for week to come he must not walk nor move hi arm nor so much as speak when he could help it my own accident cut across the knuckl wa a fleabit doctor livesei patch it up with plaster and pull my ear for me into the bargain after dinner the squir and the doctor sat by the captain side awhil in consult and when thei had talk to their heart content it be then a littl past noon the doctor took up hi hat and pistol girt on a cutlass put the chart in hi pocket and with a musket over hi shoulder cross the palisad on the north side and set off briskli through the tree grai and i were sit togeth at the far end of the block hous to be out of earshot of our offic consult and grai took hi pipe out of hi mouth and fairli forgot to put it back again so thunderstruck he wa at thi occurr why in the name of davi jone said he is dr livesei mad why no sai i he about the last of thi crew for that i take it well shipmat said grai mad he mai not be but if he not you mark my word i am i take it repli i the doctor ha hi idea and if i am right he go now to see ben gunn i wa right as appear later but in the meantim the hous be stifl hot and the littl patch of sand insid the palisad ablaz with middai sun i began to get anoth thought into my head which wa not by ani mean so right what i began to do wa to envi the doctor walk in the cool shadow of the wood with the bird about him and the pleasant smell of the pine while i sat grill with my cloth stuck to the hot resin and so much blood about me and so mani poor dead bodi ly all around that i took a disgust of the place that wa almost as strong as fear all the time i wa wash out the block hous and then wash up the thing from dinner thi disgust and envi kept grow stronger and stronger till at last be near a breadbag and no on then observ me i took the first step toward my escapad and fill both pocket of my coat with biscuit i wa a fool if you like and certainli i wa go to do a foolish overbold act but i wa determin to do it with all the precaut in my power these biscuit should anyth befal me would keep me at least from starv till far on in the next dai the next thing i laid hold of wa a brace of pistol and as i alreadi had a powderhorn and bullet i felt myself well suppli with arm as for the scheme i had in my head it wa not a bad on in itself i wa to go down the sandi spit that divid the anchorag on the east from the open sea find the white rock i had observ last even and ascertain whether it wa there or not that ben gunn had hidden hi boat a thing quit worth do as i still believ but as i wa certain i should not be allow to leav the enclosur my onli plan wa to take french leav and slip out when nobodi wa watch and that wa so bad a wai of do it as made the thing itself wrong but i wa onli a boi and i had made my mind up well as thing at last fell out i found an admir opportun the squir and grai were busi help the captain with hi bandag the coast wa clear i made a bolt for it over the stockad and into the thickest of the tree and befor my absenc wa observ i wa out of cry of my companion thi wa my second folli far wors than the first as i left but two sound men to guard the hous but like the first it wa a help toward save all of us i took my wai straight for the east coast of the island for i wa determin to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chanc of observ from the anchorag it wa alreadi late in the afternoon although still warm and sunni as i continu to thread the tall wood i could hear from far befor me not onli the continu thunder of the surf but a certain toss of foliag and grind of bough which show me the sea breez had set in higher than usual soon cool draught of air began to reach me and a few step farther i came forth into the open border of the grove and saw the sea ly blue and sunni to the horizon and the surf tumbl and toss it foam along the beach i have never seen the sea quiet round treasur island the sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surfac smooth and blue but still these great roller would be run along all the extern coast thunder and thunder by dai and night and i scarc believ there is on spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their nois i walk along besid the surf with great enjoy till think i wa now got far enough to the south i took the cover of some thick bush and crept warili up to the ridg of the spit behind me wa the sea in front the anchorag the sea breez as though it had the sooner blown itself out by it unusu violenc wa alreadi at an end it had been succeed by light variabl air from the south and southeast carri great bank of fog and the anchorag under lee of skeleton island lai still and leaden as when first we enter it the hispaniola in that unbroken mirror wa exactli portrai from the truck to the waterlin the jolli roger hang from her peak alongsid lai on of the gig silver in the sternsheetshim i could alwai recognizewhil a coupl of men were lean over the stern bulwark on of them with a red capth veri rogu that i had seen some hour befor strideleg upon the palisad appar thei were talk and laugh though at that distanceupward of a milei could of cours hear no word of what wa said all at onc there began the most horrid unearthli scream which at first startl me badli though i had soon rememb the voic of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumag as she sat perch upon her master wrist soon after the jollyboat shove off and pull for shore and the man with the red cap and hi comrad went below by the cabin companion just about the same time the sun had gone down behind the spyglass and as the fog wa collect rapidli it began to grow dark in earnest i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that even the white rock visibl enough abov the brush wa still some eighth of a mile further down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawl often on all four among the scrub night had almost come when i laid my hand on it rough side right below it there wa an exceedingli small hollow of green turf hidden by bank and a thick underwood about kneedeep that grew there veri plentifulli and in the centr of the dell sure enough a littl tent of goatskin like what the gipsi carri about with them in england i drop into the hollow lift the side of the tent and there wa ben gunn boathomemad if ever anyth wa homemad a rude lopsid framework of tough wood and stretch upon that a cover of goatskin with the hair insid the thing wa extrem small even for me and i can hardli imagin that it could have float with a fullsiz man there wa on thwart set as low as possibl a kind of stretcher in the bow and a doubl paddl for propuls i had not then seen a coracl such as the ancient briton made but i have seen on sinc and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunn boat than by sai it wa like the first and the worst coracl ever made by man but the great advantag of the coracl it certainli possess for it wa exceedingli light and portabl well now that i had found the boat you would have thought i had had enough of truantri for onc but in the meantim i had taken anoth notion and becom so obstin fond of it that i would have carri it out i believ in the teeth of captain smollett himself thi wa to slip out under cover of the night cut the hispaniola adrift and let her go ashor where she fanci i had quit made up my mind that the mutin after their repuls of the morn had noth nearer their heart than to up anchor and awai to sea thi i thought it would be a fine thing to prevent and now that i had seen how thei left their watchmen unprovid with a boat i thought it might be done with littl risk down i sat to wait for dark and made a hearti meal of biscuit it wa a night out of ten thousand for my purpos the fog had now buri all heaven as the last rai of daylight dwindl and disappear absolut black settl down on treasur island and when at last i shoulder the coracl and grope my wai stumblingli out of the hollow where i had sup there were but two point visibl on the whole anchorag on wa the great fire on shore by which the defeat pirat lai carous in the swamp the other a mere blur of light upon the dark indic the posit of the anchor ship she had swung round to the ebbher bow wa now toward meth onli light on board were in the cabin and what i saw wa mere a reflect on the fog of the strong rai that flow from the stern window the ebb had alreadi run some time and i had to wade through a long belt of swampi sand where i sank sever time abov the ankl befor i came to the edg of the retreat water and wade a littl wai in with some strength and dexter set my coracl keel downward on the surfac the ebbtid run the coraclea i had ampl reason to know befor i wa done with herwa a veri safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seawai but she wa the most crossgrain lopsid craft to manag do as you pleas she alwai made more leewai than anyth els and turn round and round wa the manoeuvr she wa best at even ben gunn himself ha admit that she wa queer to handl till you knew her wai certainli i did not know her wai she turn in everi direct but the on i wa bound to go the most part of the time we were broadsid on and i am veri sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide by good fortun paddl as i pleas the tide wa still sweep me down and there lai the hispaniola right in the fairwai hardli to be miss first she loom befor me like a blot of someth yet blacker than dark then her spar and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seem for the farther i went the brisker grew the current of the ebb i wa alongsid of her hawser and had laid hold the hawser wa as taut as a bowstr and the current so strong she pull upon her anchor all round the hull in the black the rippl current bubbl and chatter like a littl mountain stream on cut with my seagulli and the hispaniola would go hum down the tide so far so good but it next occur to my recollect that a taut hawser suddenli cut is a thing as danger as a kick hors ten to on if i were so foolhardi as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor i and the coracl would be knock clean out of the water thi brought me to a full stop and if fortun had not again particularli favour me i should have had to abandon my design but the light air which had begun blow from the southeast and south had haul round after nightfal into the southwest just while i wa medit a puff came caught the hispaniola and forc her up into the current and to my great joi i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water with that i made my mind up took out my gulli open it with my teeth and cut on strand after anoth till the vessel swung onli by two then i lai quiet wait to sever these last when the strain should be onc more lighten by a breath of wind all thi time i had heard the sound of loud voic from the cabin but to sai truth my mind had been so entir taken up with other thought that i had scarc given ear now howev when i had noth els to do i began to pai more heed on i recogn for the coxswain israel hand that had been flint gunner in former dai the other wa of cours my friend of the red nightcap both men were plainli the wors of drink and thei were still drink for even while i wa listen on of them with a drunken cry open the stern window and threw out someth which i divin to be an empti bottl but thei were not onli tipsi it wa plain that thei were furious angri oath flew like hailston and everi now and then there came forth such an explos as i thought wa sure to end in blow but each time the quarrel pass off and the voic grumbl lower for a while until the next crisi came and in it turn pass awai without result on shore i could see the glow of the great campfir burn warmli through the shoresid tree someon wa sing a dull old drone sailor song with a droop and a quaver at the end of everi vers and seemingli no end to it at all but the patienc of the singer i had heard it on the voyag more than onc and rememb these word but on man of her crew aliv what put to sea with seventyf and i thought it wa a ditti rather too dolefulli appropri for a compani that had met such cruel loss in the morn but inde from what i saw all these buccan were as callou as the sea thei sail on at last the breez came the schooner sidl and drew nearer in the dark i felt the hawser slacken onc more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibr through the breez had but littl action on the coracl and i wa almost instantli swept against the bow of the hispaniola at the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spin slowli end for end across the current i wrought like a fiend for i expect everi moment to be swamp and sinc i found i could not push the coracl directli off i now shove straight astern at length i wa clear of my danger neighbour and just as i gave the last impuls my hand came across a light cord that wa trail overboard across the stern bulwark instantli i grasp it why i should have done so i can hardli sai it wa at first mere instinct but onc i had it in my hand and found it fast curios began to get the upper hand and i determin i should have on look through the cabin window i pull in hand over hand on the cord and when i judg myself near enough rose at infinit risk to about half my height and thu command the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin by thi time the schooner and her littl consort were glide pretti swiftli through the water inde we had alreadi fetch up level with the campfir the ship wa talk as sailor sai loudli tread the innumer rippl with an incess welter splash and until i got my ey abov the windowsil i could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm on glanc howev wa suffici and it wa onli on glanc that i durst take from that unsteadi skiff it show me hand and hi companion lock togeth in deadli wrestl each with a hand upon the other throat i drop upon the thwart again none too soon for i wa near overboard i could see noth for the moment but these two furiou encrimson face swai togeth under the smoki lamp and i shut my ey to let them grow onc more familiar with the dark the endless ballad had come to an end at last and the whole diminish compani about the campfir had broken into the choru i had heard so often fifteen men on the dead man chest yohoho and a bottl of rum drink and the devil had done for the rest yohoho and a bottl of rum i wa just think how busi drink and the devil were at that veri moment in the cabin of the hispaniola when i wa surpris by a sudden lurch of the coracl at the same moment she yaw sharpli and seem to chang her cours the speed in the meantim had strang increas i open my ey at onc all round me were littl rippl comb over with a sharp bristl sound and slightli phosphoresc the hispaniola herself a few yard in whose wake i wa still be whirl along seem to stagger in her cours and i saw her spar toss a littl against the black of the night nai as i look longer i made sure she also wa wheel to the southward i glanc over my shoulder and my heart jump against my rib there right behind me wa the glow of the campfir the current had turn at right angl sweep round along with it the tall schooner and the littl danc coracl ever quicken ever bubbl higher ever mutter louder it went spin through the narrow for the open sea suddenli the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw turn perhap through twenti degre and almost at the same moment on shout follow anoth from on board i could hear feet pound on the companion ladder and i knew that the two drunkard had at last been interrupt in their quarrel and awaken to a sens of their disast i lai down flat in the bottom of that wretch skiff and devoutli recommend my spirit to it maker at the end of the strait i made sure we must fall into some bar of rage breaker where all my troubl would be end speedili and though i could perhap bear to die i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approach so i must have lain for hour continu beaten to and fro upon the billow now and again wet with fly sprai and never ceas to expect death at the next plung gradual weari grew upon me a numb an occasion stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terror until sleep at last superven and in my seatoss coracl i lai and dream of home and the old admir benbow the cruis of the coracl it wa broad dai when i awok and found myself toss at the southwest end of treasur island the sun wa up but wa still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spyglass which on thi side descend almost to the sea in formid cliff haulbowlin head and mizzenmast hill were at my elbow the hill bare and dark the head bound with cliff forti or fifti feet high and fring with great mass of fallen rock i wa scarc a quarter of a mile to seaward and it wa my first thought to paddl in and land that notion wa soon given over among the fallen rock the breaker spout and bellow loud reverber heavi sprai fly and fall succeed on anoth from second to second and i saw myself if i ventur nearer dash to death upon the rough shore or spend my strength in vain to scale the beetl crag nor wa that all for crawl togeth on flat tabl of rock or let themselv drop into the sea with loud report i beheld huge slimi monsterssoft snail as it were of incred bignesstwo or three score of them togeth make the rock to echo with their bark i have understood sinc that thei were sea lion and entir harmless but the look of them ad to the difficulti of the shore and the high run of the surf wa more than enough to disgust me of that landingplac i felt will rather to starv at sea than to confront such peril in the meantim i had a better chanc as i suppos befor me north of haulbowlin head the land run in a long wai leav at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand to the north of that again there come anoth capecap of the wood as it wa mark upon the chartburi in tall green pine which descend to the margin of the sea i rememb what silver had said about the current that set northward along the whole west coast of treasur island and see from my posit that i wa alreadi under it influenc i prefer to leav haulbowlin head behind me and reserv my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlierlook cape of the wood there wa a great smooth swell upon the sea the wind blow steadi and gentl from the south there wa no contrarieti between that and the current and the billow rose and fell unbroken had it been otherwis i must long ago have perish but as it wa it is surpris how easili and secur my littl and light boat could ride often as i still lai at the bottom and kept no more than an ey abov the gunwal i would see a big blue summit heav close abov me yet the coracl would but bounc a littl danc as if on spring and subsid on the other side into the trough as lightli as a bird i began after a littl to grow veri bold and sat up to try my skill at paddl but even a small chang in the disposit of the weight will produc violent chang in the behaviour of a coracl and i had hardli move befor the boat give up at onc her gentl danc movement ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddi and struck her nose with a spout of sprai deep into the side of the next wave i wa drench and terrifi and fell instantli back into my old posit whereupon the coracl seem to find her head again and led me as softli as befor among the billow it wa plain she wa not to be interf with and at that rate sinc i could in no wai influenc her cours what hope had i left of reach land i began to be horribl frighten but i kept my head for all that first move with all care i gradual bale out the coracl with my seacap then get my ey onc more abov the gunwal i set myself to studi how it wa she manag to slip so quietli through the roller i found each wave instead of the big smooth glossi mountain it look from shore or from a vessel deck wa for all the world like ani rang of hill on dry land full of peak and smooth place and vallei the coracl left to herself turn from side to side thread so to speak her wai through these lower part and avoid the steep slope and higher toppl summit of the wave well now thought i to myself it is plain i must lie where i am and not disturb the balanc but it is plain also that i can put the paddl over the side and from time to time in smooth place give her a shove or two toward land no sooner thought upon than done there i lai on my elbow in the most try attitud and everi now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore it wa veri tire and slow work yet i did visibl gain ground and as we drew near the cape of the wood though i saw i must infal miss that point i had still made some hundr yard of east i wa inde close in i could see the cool green treetop swai togeth in the breez and i felt sure i should make the next promontori without fail it wa high time for i now began to be tortur with thirst the glow of the sun from abov it thousandfold reflect from the wave the seawat that fell and dri upon me cake my veri lip with salt combin to make my throat burn and my brain ach the sight of the tree so near at hand had almost made me sick with long but the current had soon carri me past the point and as the next reach of sea open out i beheld a sight that chang the natur of my thought right in front of me not half a mile awai i beheld the hispaniola under sail i made sure of cours that i should be taken but i wa so distress for want of water that i scarc knew whether to be glad or sorri at the thought and long befor i had come to a conclus surpris had taken entir possess of my mind and i could do noth but stare and wonder the hispaniola wa under her mainsail and two jib and the beauti white canva shone in the sun like snow or silver when i first sight her all her sail were draw she wa ly a cours about northwest and i presum the men on board were go round the island on their wai back to the anchorag present she began to fetch more and more to the westward so that i thought thei had sight me and were go about in chase at last howev she fell right into the wind ey wa taken dead aback and stood there awhil helpless with her sail shiver clumsi fellow said i thei must still be drunk as owl and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skip meanwhil the schooner gradual fell off and fill again upon anoth tack sail swiftli for a minut or so and brought up onc more dead in the wind ey again and again wa thi repeat to and fro up and down north south east and west the hispaniola sail by swoop and dash and at each repetit end as she had begun with idli flap canva it becam plain to me that nobodi wa steer and if so where were the men either thei were dead drunk or had desert her i thought and perhap if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain the current wa bear coracl and schooner southward at an equal rate as for the latter sail it wa so wild and intermitt and she hung each time so long in iron that she certainli gain noth if she did not even lose if onli i dare to sit up and paddl i made sure that i could overhaul her the scheme had an air of adventur that inspir me and the thought of the water breaker besid the fore companion doubl my grow courag up i got wa welcom almost instantli by anoth cloud of sprai but thi time stuck to my purpos and set myself with all my strength and caution to paddl after the unsteer hispaniola onc i ship a sea so heavi that i had to stop and bail with my heart flutter like a bird but gradual i got into the wai of the thing and guid my coracl among the wave with onli now and then a blow upon her bow and a dash of foam in my face i wa now gain rapidli on the schooner i could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it bang about and still no soul appear upon her deck i could not choos but suppos she wa desert if not the men were ly drunk below where i might batten them down perhap and do what i chose with the ship for some time she had been do the wors thing possibl for mestand still she head nearli due south yaw of cours all the time each time she fell off her sail partli fill and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again i have said thi wa the worst thing possibl for me for helpless as she look in thi situat with the canva crack like cannon and the block trundl and bang on the deck she still continu to run awai from me not onli with the speed of the current but by the whole amount of her leewai which wa natur great but now at last i had my chanc the breez fell for some second veri low and the current gradual turn her the hispaniola revolv slowli round her centr and at last present me her stern with the cabin window still gape open and the lamp over the tabl still burn on into the dai the mainsail hung droop like a banner she wa stockstil but for the current for the last littl while i had even lost but now redoubl my effort i began onc more to overhaul the chase i wa not a hundr yard from her when the wind came again in a clap she fill on the port tack and wa off again stoop and skim like a swallow my first impuls wa on of despair but my second wa toward joi round she came till she wa broadsid on to meround still till she had cover a half and then two third and then three quarter of the distanc that separ us i could see the wave boil white under her forefoot immens tall she look to me from my low station in the coracl and then of a sudden i began to comprehend i had scarc time to thinkscarc time to act and save myself i wa on the summit of on swell when the schooner came stoop over the next the bowsprit wa over my head i sprang to my feet and leap stamp the coracl under water with on hand i caught the jibboom while my foot wa lodg between the stai and the brace and as i still clung there pant a dull blow told me that the schooner had charg down upon and struck the coracl and that i wa left without retreat on the hispaniola i strike the jolli roger i had scarc gain a posit on the bowsprit when the fly jib flap and fill upon the other tack with a report like a gun the schooner trembl to her keel under the revers but next moment the other sail still draw the jib flap back again and hung idl thi had nearli toss me off into the sea and now i lost no time crawl back along the bowsprit and tumbl head foremost on the deck i wa on the lee side of the forecastl and the mainsail which wa still draw conceal from me a certain portion of the afterdeck not a soul wa to be seen the plank which had not been swab sinc the mutini bore the print of mani feet and an empti bottl broken by the neck tumbl to and fro like a live thing in the scupper suddenli the hispaniola came right into the wind the jib behind me crack aloud the rudder slam to the whole ship gave a sicken heav and shudder and at the same moment the mainboom swung inboard the sheet groan in the block and show me the lee afterdeck there were the two watchmen sure enough redcap on hi back as stiff as a handspik with hi arm stretch out like those of a crucifix and hi teeth show through hi open lip israel hand prop against the bulwark hi chin on hi chest hi hand ly open befor him on the deck hi face as white under it tan as a tallow candl for a while the ship kept buck and sidl like a viciou hors the sail fill now on on tack now on anoth and the boom swing to and fro till the mast groan aloud under the strain now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprai over the bulwark and a heavi blow of the ship bow against the swell so much heavier weather wa made of it by thi great rig ship than by my homemad lopsid coracl now gone to the bottom of the sea at everi jump of the schooner redcap slip to and fro butwhat wa ghastli to beholdneith hi attitud nor hi fix teethdisclos grin wa anywai disturb by thi rough usag at everi jump too hand appear still more to sink into himself and settl down upon the deck hi feet slide ever the farther out and the whole bodi cant toward the stern so that hi face becam littl by littl hid from me and at last i could see noth beyond hi ear and the frai ringlet of on whisker at the same time i observ around both of them splash of dark blood upon the plank and began to feel sure that thei had kill each other in their drunken wrath while i wa thu look and wonder in a calm moment when the ship wa still israel hand turn partli round and with a low moan writh himself back to the posit in which i had seen him first the moan which told of pain and deadli weak and the wai in which hi jaw hung open went right to my heart but when i rememb the talk i had overheard from the appl barrel all piti left me i walk aft until i reach the mainmast come aboard mr hand i said iron he roll hi ey round heavili but he wa too far gone to express surpris all he could do wa to utter on word brandi it occur to me there wa no time to lose and dodg the boom as it onc more lurch across the deck i slip aft and down the companion stair into the cabin it wa such a scene of confus as you can hardli fanci all the lockfast place had been broken open in quest of the chart the floor wa thick with mud where ruffian had sat down to drink or consult after wade in the marsh round their camp the bulkhead all paint in clear white and bead round with gilt bore a pattern of dirti hand dozen of empti bottl clink togeth in corner to the roll of the ship on of the doctor medic book lai open on the tabl half of the leav gut out i suppos for pipelight in the midst of all thi the lamp still cast a smoki glow obscur and brown as umber i went into the cellar all the barrel were gone and of the bottl a most surpris number had been drunk out and thrown awai certainli sinc the mutini began not a man of them could ever have been sober forag about i found a bottl with some brandi left for hand and for myself i rout out some biscuit some pickl fruit a great bunch of raisin and a piec of chees with these i came on deck put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain reach went forward to the waterbreak and had a good deep drink of water and then and not till then gave hand the brandi he must have drunk a gill befor he took the bottl from hi mouth ay said he by thunder but i want some o that i had sat down alreadi in my own corner and begun to eat much hurt i ask him he grunt or rather i might sai he bark if that doctor wa aboard he said id be right enough in a coupl of turn but i dont have no manner of luck you see and that what the matter with me as for that swab he good and dead he is he ad indic the man with the red cap he warnt no seaman anyhow and where mought you have come from well said i iv come aboard to take possess of thi ship mr hand and youll pleas regard me as your captain until further notic he look at me sourli enough but said noth some of the colour had come back into hi cheek though he still look veri sick and still continu to slip out and settl down as the ship bang about by the by i continu i cant have these colour mr hand and by your leav ill strike em better none than these and again dodg the boom i ran to the colour line hand down their curs black flag and chuck it overboard god save the king said i wave my cap and there an end to captain silver he watch me keenli and slyli hi chin all the while on hi breast i reckon he said at last i reckon capn hawkin youll kind of want to get ashor now spose we talk why ye sai i with all my heart mr hand sai on and i went back to my meal with a good appetit thi man he began nod feebli at the corps obrien were hi name a rank irelanderthi man and me got the canva on her mean for to sail her back well he dead now he isa dead as bilg and who to sail thi ship i dont see without i give you a hint you aint that man as far i can tell now look here you give me food and drink and a old scarf or ankech to tie my wound up you do and ill tell you how to sail her and that about squar all round i take it ill tell you on thing sai i im not go back to captain kidd anchorag i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietli there to be sure you did he cri why i aint sich an infern lubber after all i can see cant i iv tri my fling i have and iv lost and it you ha the wind of me north inlet why i havent no chice not i id help you sail her up to execut dock by thunder so i would well as it seem to me there wa some sens in thi we struck our bargain on the spot in three minut i had the hispaniola sail easili befor the wind along the coast of treasur island with good hope of turn the northern point er noon and beat down again as far as north inlet befor high water when we might beach her safe and wait till the subsid tide permit us to land then i lash the tiller and went below to my own chest where i got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother with thi and with my aid hand bound up the great bleed stab he had receiv in the thigh and after he had eaten a littl and had a swallow or two more of the brandi he began to pick up visibl sat straighter up spoke louder and clearer and look in everi wai anoth man the breez serv us admir we skim befor it like a bird the coast of the island flash by and the view chang everi minut soon we were past the high land and bowl besid low sandi countri spars dot with dwarf pine and soon we were beyond that again and had turn the corner of the rocki hill that end the island on the north i wa greatli elat with my new command and pleas with the bright sunshini weather and these differ prospect of the coast i had now plenti of water and good thing to eat and my conscienc which had smitten me hard for my desert wa quiet by the great conquest i had made i should i think have had noth left me to desir but for the ey of the coxswain as thei follow me deris about the deck and the odd smile that appear continu on hi face it wa a smile that had in it someth both of pain and weaknessa haggard old man smile but there wa besid that a grain of deris a shadow of treacheri in hi express as he craftili watch and watch and watch me at my work israel hand the wind serv us to a desir now haul into the west we could run so much the easier from the northeast corner of the island to the mouth of the north inlet onli as we had no power to anchor and dare not beach her till the tide had flow a good deal farther time hung on our hand the coxswain told me how to lai the ship to after a good mani trial i succeed and we both sat in silenc over anoth meal capn said he at length with that same uncomfort smile here my old shipmat obrien spose you wa to heav him overboard i aint particlar as a rule and i dont take no blame for settl hi hash but i dont reckon him ornament now do you im not strong enough and i dont like the job and there he li for me said i thi here an unlucki ship thi hispaniola jim he went on blink there a power of men been kill in thi hispaniolaa sight o poor seamen dead and gone sinc you and me took ship to bristol i never seen sich dirti luck not i there wa thi here obrien nowh dead aint he well now im no scholar and your a lad as can read and figur and to put it straight do you take it as a dead man is dead for good or do he come aliv again you can kill the bodi mr hand but not the spirit you must know that alreadi i repli obrien there is in anoth world and mai be watch us ah sai he well that unfortnateappear as if kill parti wa a wast of time howsomev sperrit dont reckon for much by what iv seen ill chanc it with the sperrit jim and now youv spoke up free and ill take it kind if youd step down into that there cabin and get me awel ashiv my timber i cant hit the name on t well you get me a bottl of wine jimthi here brandi too strong for my head now the coxswain hesit seem to be unnatur and as for the notion of hi prefer wine to brandi i entir disbeliev it the whole stori wa a pretext he want me to leav the deckso much wa plain but with what purpos i could in no wai imagin hi ey never met mine thei kept wander to and fro up and down now with a look to the sky now with a flit glanc upon the dead obrien all the time he kept smile and put hi tongu out in the most guilti embarrass manner so that a child could have told that he wa bent on some decept i wa prompt with my answer howev for i saw where my advantag lai and that with a fellow so dens stupid i could easili conceal my suspicion to the end some wine i said far better will you have white or red well i reckon it about the bless same to me shipmat he repli so it strong and plenti of it what the odd all right i answer ill bring you port mr hand but ill have to dig for it with that i scuttl down the companion with all the nois i could slip off my shoe ran quietli along the spar galleri mount the forecastl ladder and pop my head out of the fore companion i knew he would not expect to see me there yet i took everi precaut possibl and certainli the worst of my suspicion prove too true he had risen from hi posit to hi hand and knee and though hi leg obvious hurt him pretti sharpli when he movedfor i could hear him stifl a groanyet it wa at a good rattl rate that he trail himself across the deck in half a minut he had reach the port scupper and pick out of a coil of rope a long knife or rather a short dirk discolour to the hilt with blood he look upon it for a moment thrust forth hi under jaw tri the point upon hi hand and then hastili conceal it in the bosom of hi jacket trundl back again into hi old place against the bulwark thi wa all that i requir to know israel could move about he wa now arm and if he had been at so much troubl to get rid of me it wa plain that i wa meant to be the victim what he would do afterwardswheth he would try to crawl right across the island from north inlet to the camp among the swamp or whether he would fire long tom trust that hi own comrad might come first to help himwa of cours more than i could sai yet i felt sure that i could trust him in on point sinc in that our interest jump togeth and that wa in the disposit of the schooner we both desir to have her strand safe enough in a shelter place and so that when the time came she could be got off again with as littl labour and danger as might be and until that wa done i consid that my life would certainli be spare while i wa thu turn the busi over in my mind i had not been idl with my bodi i had stolen back to the cabin slip onc more into my shoe and laid my hand at random on a bottl of wine and now with thi for an excus i made my reappear on the deck hand lai as i had left him all fallen togeth in a bundl and with hi eyelid lower as though he were too weak to bear the light he look up howev at my come knock the neck off the bottl like a man who had done the same thing often and took a good swig with hi favourit toast of here luck then he lai quiet for a littl and then pull out a stick of tobacco beg me to cut him a quid cut me a junk o that sai he for i havent no knife and hardli strength enough so be as i had ah jim jim i reckon iv miss stai cut me a quid asll like be the last lad for im for my long home and no mistak well said i ill cut you some tobacco but if i wa you and thought myself so badli i would go to my prayer like a christian man why said he now you tell me why why i cri you were ask me just now about the dead youv broken your trust youv live in sin and li and blood there a man you kill ly at your feet thi moment and you ask me why for god merci mr hand that why i spoke with a littl heat think of the bloodi dirk he had hidden in hi pocket and design in hi ill thought to end me with he for hi part took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusu solemn for thirti year he said iv sail the sea and seen good and bad better and wors fair weather and foul provis run out knive go and what not well now i tell you i never seen good come o good yet him as strike first is my fanci dead men dont bite them my viewsamen so be it and now you look here he ad suddenli chang hi tone weve had about enough of thi fooleri the tide made good enough by now you just take my order capn hawkin and well sail slap in and be done with it all told we had scarc two mile to run but the navig wa delic the entranc to thi northern anchorag wa not onli narrow and shoal but lai east and west so that the schooner must be nice handl to be got in i think i wa a good prompt subaltern and i am veri sure that hand wa an excel pilot for we went about and about and dodg in shave the bank with a certainti and a neat that were a pleasur to behold scarc had we pass the head befor the land close around us the shore of north inlet were as thickli wood as those of the southern anchorag but the space wa longer and narrow and more like what in truth it wa the estuari of a river right befor us at the southern end we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stage of dilapid it had been a great vessel of three mast but had lain so long expos to the injuri of the weather that it wa hung about with great web of drip seawe and on the deck of it shore bush had taken root and now flourish thick with flower it wa a sad sight but it show us that the anchorag wa calm now said hand look there there a pet bit for to beach a ship in fine flat sand never a cat paw tree all around of it and flower ablow like a gard on that old ship and onc beach i inquir how shall we get her off again why so he repli you take a line ashor there on the other side at low water take a turn about on of them big pine bring it back take a turn around the capstan and lie to for the tide come high water all hand take a pull upon the line and off she come as sweet as natur and now boi you stand by were near the bit now and she too much wai on her starboard a littlesosteadystarboardlarboard a littlesteadysteadi so he issu hi command which i breathlessli obei till all of a sudden he cri now my hearti luff and i put the helm hard up and the hispaniola swung round rapidli and ran stem on for the low wood shore the excit of these last manoeuvr had somewhat interf with the watch i had kept hitherto sharpli enough upon the coxswain even then i wa still so much interest wait for the ship to touch that i had quit forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood crane over the starboard bulwark and watch the rippl spread wide befor the bow i might have fallen without a struggl for my life had not a sudden disquietud seiz upon me and made me turn my head perhap i had heard a creak or seen hi shadow move with the tail of my ey perhap it wa an instinct like a cat but sure enough when i look round there wa hand alreadi halfwai toward me with the dirk in hi right hand we must both have cri out aloud when our ey met but while mine wa the shrill cry of terror hi wa a roar of furi like a charg bulli at the same instant he threw himself forward and i leapt sidewai toward the bow as i did so i let go of the tiller which sprang sharp to leeward and i think thi save my life for it struck hand across the chest and stop him for the moment dead befor he could recov i wa safe out of the corner where he had me trap with all the deck to dodg about just forward of the mainmast i stop drew a pistol from my pocket took a cool aim though he had alreadi turn and wa onc more come directli after me and drew the trigger the hammer fell but there follow neither flash nor sound the prime wa useless with seawat i curs myself for my neglect why had not i long befor reprim and reload my onli weapon then i should not have been as now a mere flee sheep befor thi butcher wound as he wa it wa wonder how fast he could move hi grizzl hair tumbl over hi face and hi face itself as red as a red ensign with hi hast and furi i had no time to try my other pistol nor inde much inclin for i wa sure it would be useless on thing i saw plainli i must not simpli retreat befor him or he would speedili hold me box into the bow as a moment sinc he had so nearli box me in the stern onc so caught and nine or ten inch of the bloodstain dirk would be my last experi on thi side of etern i place my palm against the mainmast which wa of a goodish big and wait everi nerv upon the stretch see that i meant to dodg he also paus and a moment or two pass in feint on hi part and correspond movement upon mine it wa such a game as i had often plai at home about the rock of black hill cove but never befor you mai be sure with such a wildli beat heart as now still as i sai it wa a boi game and i thought i could hold my own at it against an elderli seaman with a wound thigh inde my courag had begun to rise so high that i allow myself a few dart thought on what would be the end of the affair and while i saw certainli that i could spin it out for long i saw no hope of ani ultim escap well while thing stood thu suddenli the hispaniola struck stagger ground for an instant in the sand and then swift as a blow cant over to the port side till the deck stood at an angl of fortyf degre and about a puncheon of water splash into the scupper hole and lai in a pool between the deck and bulwark we were both of us capsiz in a second and both of us roll almost togeth into the scupper the dead redcap with hi arm still spread out tumbl stiffli after us so near were we inde that my head came against the coxswain foot with a crack that made my teeth rattl blow and all i wa the first afoot again for hand had got involv with the dead bodi the sudden cant of the ship had made the deck no place for run on i had to find some new wai of escap and that upon the instant for my foe wa almost touch me quick as thought i sprang into the mizzen shroud rattl up hand over hand and did not draw a breath till i wa seat on the crosstre i had been save by be prompt the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as i pursu my upward flight and there stood israel hand with hi mouth open and hi face upturn to mine a perfect statu of surpris and disappoint now that i had a moment to myself i lost no time in chang the prime of my pistol and then have on readi for servic and to make assur doubli sure i proceed to draw the load of the other and recharg it afresh from the begin my new employ struck hand all of a heap he began to see the dice go against him and after an obviou hesit he also haul himself heavili into the shroud and with the dirk in hi teeth began slowli and painfulli to mount it cost him no end of time and groan to haul hi wound leg behind him and i had quietli finish my arrang befor he wa much more than a third of the wai up then with a pistol in either hand i address him on more step mr hand said i and ill blow your brain out dead men dont bite you know i ad with a chuckl he stop instantli i could see by the work of hi face that he wa try to think and the process wa so slow and labori that in my newfound secur i laugh aloud at last with a swallow or two he spoke hi face still wear the same express of extrem perplex in order to speak he had to take the dagger from hi mouth but in all els he remain unmov jim sai he i reckon were foul you and me and well have to sign articl id have had you but for that there lurch but i dont have no luck not i and i reckon ill have to strike which come hard you see for a master marin to a ship younker like you jim i wa drink in hi word and smile awai as conceit as a cock upon a wall when all in a breath back went hi right hand over hi shoulder someth sang like an arrow through the air i felt a blow and then a sharp pang and there i wa pin by the shoulder to the mast in the horrid pain and surpris of the momenti scarc can sai it wa by my own volit and i am sure it wa without a consciou aimboth my pistol went off and both escap out of my hand thei did not fall alon with a choke cry the coxswain loos hi grasp upon the shroud and plung head first into the water piec of eight ow to the cant of the vessel the mast hung far out over the water and from my perch on the crosstre i had noth below me but the surfac of the bai hand who wa not so far up wa in consequ nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwark he rose onc to the surfac in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good as the water settl i could see him ly huddl togeth on the clean bright sand in the shadow of the vessel side a fish or two whip past hi bodi sometim by the quiver of the water he appear to move a littl as if he were try to rise but he wa dead enough for all that be both shot and drown and wa food for fish in the veri place where he had design my slaughter i wa no sooner certain of thi than i began to feel sick faint and terrifi the hot blood wa run over my back and chest the dirk where it had pin my shoulder to the mast seem to burn like a hot iron yet it wa not so much these real suffer that distress me for these it seem to me i could bear without a murmur it wa the horror i had upon my mind of fall from the crosstre into that still green water besid the bodi of the coxswain i clung with both hand till my nail ach and i shut my ey as if to cover up the peril gradual my mind came back again my puls quiet down to a more natur time and i wa onc more in possess of myself it wa my first thought to pluck forth the dirk but either it stuck too hard or my nerv fail me and i desist with a violent shudder oddli enough that veri shudder did the busi the knife in fact had come the nearest in the world to miss me altogeth it held me by a mere pinch of skin and thi the shudder tore awai the blood ran down the faster to be sure but i wa my own master again and onli tack to the mast by my coat and shirt these last i broke through with a sudden jerk and then regain the deck by the starboard shroud for noth in the world would i have again ventur shaken as i wa upon the overhang port shroud from which israel had so late fallen i went below and did what i could for my wound it pain me a good deal and still bled freeli but it wa neither deep nor danger nor did it greatli gall me when i us my arm then i look around me and as the ship wa now in a sens my own i began to think of clear it from it last passengerth dead man obrien he had pitch as i have said against the bulwark where he lai like some horribl ungainli sort of puppet lifes inde but how differ from life colour or life comeli in that posit i could easili have my wai with him and as the habit of tragic adventur had worn off almost all my terror for the dead i took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with on good heav tumbl him overboard he went in with a sound plung the red cap came off and remain float on the surfac and as soon as the splash subsid i could see him and israel ly side by side both waver with the tremul movement of the water obrien though still quit a young man wa veri bald there he lai with that bald head across the knee of the man who had kill him and the quick fish steer to and fro over both i wa now alon upon the ship the tide had just turn the sun wa within so few degre of set that alreadi the shadow of the pine upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorag and fall in pattern on the deck the even breez had sprung up and though it wa well ward off by the hill with the two peak upon the east the cordag had begun to sing a littl softli to itself and the idl sail to rattl to and fro i began to see a danger to the ship the jib i speedili dous and brought tumbl to the deck but the mainsail wa a harder matter of cours when the schooner cant over the boom had swung outboard and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water i thought thi made it still more danger yet the strain wa so heavi that i half fear to meddl at last i got my knife and cut the halyard the peak drop instantli a great belli of loos canva float broad upon the water and sinc pull as i like i could not budg the downhal that wa the extent of what i could accomplish for the rest the hispaniola must trust to luck like myself by thi time the whole anchorag had fallen into shadowth last rai i rememb fall through a glade of the wood and shine bright as jewel on the floweri mantl of the wreck it began to be chill the tide wa rapidli fleet seaward the schooner settl more and more on her beamend i scrambl forward and look over it seem shallow enough and hold the cut hawser in both hand for a last secur i let myself drop softli overboard the water scarc reach my waist the sand wa firm and cover with rippl mark and i wade ashor in great spirit leav the hispaniola on her side with her mainsail trail wide upon the surfac of the bai about the same time the sun went fairli down and the breez whistl low in the dusk among the toss pine at least and at last i wa off the sea nor had i return thenc emptyhand there lai the schooner clear at last from buccan and readi for our own men to board and get to sea again i had noth nearer my fanci than to get home to the stockad and boast of my achiev possibl i might be blame a bit for my truantri but the recaptur of the hispaniola wa a clench answer and i hope that even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time so think and in famou spirit i began to set my face homeward for the block hous and my companion i rememb that the most easterli of the river which drain into captain kidd anchorag ran from the twopeak hill upon my left and i bent my cours in that direct that i might pass the stream while it wa small the wood wa pretti open and keep along the lower spur i had soon turn the corner of that hill and not long after wade to the midcalf across the watercours thi brought me near to where i had encount ben gunn the maroon and i walk more circumspectli keep an ey on everi side the dusk had come nigh hand complet and as i open out the cleft between the two peak i becam awar of a waver glow against the sky where as i judg the man of the island wa cook hi supper befor a roar fire and yet i wonder in my heart that he should show himself so careless for if i could see thi radianc might it not reach the ey of silver himself where he camp upon the shore among the marsh gradual the night fell blacker it wa all i could do to guid myself even roughli toward my destin the doubl hill behind me and the spyglass on my right hand loom faint and fainter the star were few and pale and in the low ground where i wander i kept trip among bush and roll into sandi pit suddenli a kind of bright fell about me i look up a pale glimmer of moonbeam had alight on the summit of the spyglass and soon after i saw someth broad and silveri move low down behind the tree and knew the moon had risen with thi to help me i pass rapidli over what remain to me of my journei and sometim walk sometim run impati drew near to the stockad yet as i began to thread the grove that li befor it i wa not so thoughtless but that i slack my pace and went a trifl warili it would have been a poor end of my adventur to get shot down by my own parti in mistak the moon wa climb higher and higher it light began to fall here and there in mass through the more open district of the wood and right in front of me a glow of a differ colour appear among the tree it wa red and hot and now and again it wa a littl darkeneda it were the ember of a bonfir smoulder for the life of me i could not think what it might be at last i came right down upon the border of the clear the western end wa alreadi steep in moonshin the rest and the block hous itself still lai in a black shadow chequer with long silveri streak of light on the other side of the hous an immens fire had burn itself into clear ember and shed a steadi red reverber contrast strongli with the mellow pale of the moon there wa not a soul stir nor a sound besid the nois of the breez i stop with much wonder in my heart and perhap a littl terror also it had not been our wai to build great fire we were inde by the captain order somewhat niggardli of firewood and i began to fear that someth had gone wrong while i wa absent i stole round by the eastern end keep close in shadow and at a conveni place where the dark wa thickest cross the palisad to make assur surer i got upon my hand and knee and crawl without a sound toward the corner of the hous as i drew nearer my heart wa suddenli and greatli lighten it is not a pleasant nois in itself and i have often complain of it at other time but just then it wa like music to hear my friend snore togeth so loud and peac in their sleep the seacri of the watch that beauti all well never fell more reassuringli on my ear in the meantim there wa no doubt of on thing thei kept an infam bad watch if it had been silver and hi lad that were now creep in on them not a soul would have seen daybreak that wa what it wa thought i to have the captain wound and again i blame myself sharpli for leav them in that danger with so few to mount guard by thi time i had got to the door and stood up all wa dark within so that i could distinguish noth by the ey as for sound there wa the steadi drone of the snorer and a small occasion nois a flicker or peck that i could in no wai account for with my arm befor me i walk steadili in i should lie down in my own place i thought with a silent chuckl and enjoi their face when thei found me in the morn my foot struck someth yieldingit wa a sleeper leg and he turn and groan but without awak and then all of a sudden a shrill voic broke forth out of the dark piec of eight piec of eight piec of eight piec of eight piec of eight and so forth without paus or chang like the clack of a tini mill silver green parrot captain flint it wa she whom i had heard peck at a piec of bark it wa she keep better watch than ani human be who thu announc my arriv with her wearisom refrain i had no time left me to recov at the sharp clip tone of the parrot the sleeper awok and sprang up

in the same wast spirit thei had cook i suppos three time more than we could eat and on of them with an empti laugh threw what wa left into the fire which blaze and roar again over thi unusu fuel i

and ben gunn the halfidiot maroon wa the hero from begin to end ben in hi long lone wander about the island had found the skeletonit wa he that had rifl it he had found the treasur he had dug it up it wa the haft of hi pickax that lai broken in the excav he had carri it on hi back in mani weari journei from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the twopoint hill at the northeast angl of the island and there it had lain store in safeti sinc two month befor the arriv of the hispaniola when the doctor had worm thi secret from him on the afternoon of the attack and when next morn he saw the anchorag desert he had gone to silver given him the chart which wa now uselessgiven him the store for ben gunn cave wa well suppli with goat meat salt by himselfgiven anyth and everyth to get a chanc of move in safeti from the stockad to the twopoint hill there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the monei as for you jim he said it went against my heart but i did what i thought best for those who had stood by their duti and if you were not on of these whose fault wa it that morn find that i wa to be involv in the horrid disappoint he had prepar for the mutin he had run all the wai to the cave and leav the squir to guard the captain had taken grai and the maroon and start make the diagon across the island to be at hand besid the pine soon howev he saw that our parti had the start of him and ben gunn be fleet of foot had been dispatch in front to do hi best alon then it had occur to him to work upon the superstit of hi former shipmat and he wa so far success that grai and the doctor had come up and were alreadi ambush befor the arriv of the treasurehunt ah said silver it were fortun for me that i had hawkin here you would have let old john be cut to bit and never given it a thought doctor not a thought repli dr livesei cheerili and by thi time we had reach the gig the doctor with the pickax demolish on of them and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for north inlet thi wa a run of eight or nine mile silver though he wa almost kill alreadi with fatigu wa set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skim swiftli over a smooth sea soon we pass out of the strait and doubl the southeast corner of the island round which four dai ago we had tow the hispaniola as we pass the twopoint hill we could see the black mouth of ben gunn cave and a figur stand by it lean on a musket it wa the squir and we wave a handkerchief and gave him three cheer in which the voic of silver join as heartili as ani three mile farther just insid the mouth of north inlet what should we meet but the hispaniola cruis by herself the last flood had lift her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorag we should never have found her more or found her strand beyond help as it wa there wa littl amiss beyond the wreck of the mainsail anoth anchor wa got readi and drop in a fathom and a half of water we all pull round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunn treasurehous and then grai singlehand return with the gig to the hispaniola where he wa to pass the night on guard a gentl slope ran up from the beach to the entranc of the cave at the top the squir met us to me he wa cordial and kind sai noth of my escapad either in the wai of blame or prais at silver polit salut he somewhat flush john silver he said your a prodigi villain and impostera monstrou impost sir i am told i am not to prosecut you well then i will not but the dead men sir hang about your neck like millston thank you kindli sir repli long john again salut i dare you to thank me cri the squir it is a gross derelict of my duti stand back and thereupon we all enter the cave it wa a larg airi place with a littl spring and a pool of clear water overhung with fern the floor wa sand befor a big fire lai captain smollett and in a far corner onli duskili flicker over by the blaze i beheld great heap of coin and quadrilater built of bar of gold that wa flint treasur that we had come so far to seek and that had cost alreadi the live of seventeen men from the hispaniola how mani it had cost in the amass what blood and sorrow what good ship scuttl on the deep what brave men walk the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and li and cruelti perhap no man aliv could tell yet there were still three upon that islandsilv and old morgan and ben gunnwho had each taken hi share in these crime as each had hope in vain to share in the reward come in jim said the captain your a good boi in your line jim but i dont think you and mell go to sea again your too much of the born favourit for me is that you john silver what bring you here man come back to my dooti sir return silver ah said the captain and that wa all he said what a supper i had of it that night with all my friend around me and what a meal it wa with ben gunn salt goat and some delicaci and a bottl of old wine from the hispaniola never i am sure were peopl gayer or happier and there wa silver sit back almost out of the firelight but eat heartili prompt to spring forward when anyth wa want even join quietli in our laughterth same bland polit obsequi seaman of the voyag out and last the next morn we fell earli to work for the transport of thi great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thenc three mile by boat to the hispaniola wa a consider task for so small a number of workmen the three fellow still abroad upon the island did not greatli troubl us a singl sentri on the shoulder of the hill wa suffici to ensur us against ani sudden onslaught and we thought besid thei had had more than enough of fight therefor the work wa push on briskli grai and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest dure their absenc pile treasur on the beach two of the bar slung in a rope end made a good load for a grown manon that he wa glad to walk slowli with for my part as i wa not much us at carri i wa kept busi all dai in the cave pack the mint monei into breadbag it wa a strang collect like billi boness hoard for the divers of coinag but so much larger and so much more vari that i think i never had more pleasur than in sort them english french spanish portugues georg and louis doubloon and doubl guinea and moidor and sequin the pictur of all the king of europ for the last hundr year strang orient piec stamp with what look like wisp of string or bit of spider web round piec and squar piec and piec bore through the middl as if to wear them round your necknearli everi varieti of monei in the world must i think have found a place in that collect and for number i am sure thei were like autumn leav so that my back ach with stoop and my finger with sort them out dai after dai thi work went on by everi even a fortun had been stow aboard but there wa anoth fortun wait for the morrow and all thi time we heard noth of the three surviv mutin at lasti think it wa on the third nightth doctor and i were stroll on the shoulder of the hill where it overlook the lowland of the isl when from out the thick dark below the wind brought us a nois between shriek and sing it wa onli a snatch that reach our ear follow by the former silenc heaven forgiv them said the doctor ti the mutin all drunk sir struck in the voic of silver from behind us silver i should sai wa allow hi entir liberti and in spite of daili rebuff seem to regard himself onc more as quit a privileg and friendli depend inde it wa remark how well he bore these slight and with what unweari polit he kept on try to ingrati himself with all yet i think none treat him better than a dog unless it wa ben gunn who wa still terribl afraid of hi old quartermast or myself who had realli someth to thank him for although for that matter i suppos i had reason to think even wors of him than anybodi els for i had seen him medit a fresh treacheri upon the plateau accordingli it wa pretti gruffli that the doctor answer him drunk or rave said he right you were sir repli silver and preciou littl odd which to you and me i suppos you would hardli ask me to call you a human man return the doctor with a sneer and so my feel mai surpris you master silver but if i were sure thei were ravinga i am moral certain on at least of them is down with feveri should leav thi camp and at whatev risk to my own carcass take them the assist of my skill ask your pardon sir you would be veri wrong quoth silver you would lose your preciou life and you mai lai to that im on your side now hand and glove and i shouldnt wish for to see the parti weaken let alon yourself see as i know what i ow you but these men down there thei couldnt keep their wordno not suppos thei wish to and what more thei couldnt believ as you could no said the doctor your the man to keep your word we know that well that wa about the last new we had of the three pirat onli onc we heard a gunshot a great wai off and suppos them to be hunt a council wa held and it wa decid that we must desert them on the islandto the huge glee i must sai of ben gunn and with the strong approv of grai we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicin and some other necessari tool cloth a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desir of the doctor a handsom present of tobacco that wa about our last do on the island befor that we had got the treasur stow and had ship enough water and the remaind of the goat meat in case of ani distress and at last on fine morn we weigh anchor which wa about all that we could manag and stood out of north inlet the same colour fly that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisad the three fellow must have been watch us closer than we thought for as we soon had prove for come through the narrow we had to lie veri near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneel togeth on a spit of sand with their arm rais in supplic it went to all our heart i think to leav them in that wretch state but we could not risk anoth mutini and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kind the doctor hail them and told them of the store we had left and where thei were to find them but thei continu to call us by name and appeal to us for god sake to be merci and not leav them to die in such a place at last see the ship still bore on her cours and wa now swiftli draw out of earshot on of themi know not which it wasleapt to hi feet with a hoars cry whip hi musket to hi shoulder and sent a shot whistl over silver head and through the mainsail after that we kept under cover of the bulwark and when next i look out thei had disappear from the spit and the spit itself had almost melt out of sight in the grow distanc that wa at least the end of that and befor noon to my inexpress joi the highest rock of treasur island had sunk into the blue round of sea we were so short of men that everyon on board had to bear a handonli the captain ly on a mattress in the stern and give hi order for though greatli recov he wa still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyag home without fresh hand and as it wa what with baffl wind and a coupl of fresh gale we were all worn out befor we reach it it wa just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beauti landlock gulf and were immedi surround by shore boat full of negro and mexican indian and halfblood sell fruit and veget and offer to dive for bit of monei the sight of so mani goodhumour face especi the black the tast of the tropic fruit and abov all the light that began to shine in the town made a most charm contrast to our dark and bloodi sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squir take me along with them went ashor to pass the earli part of the night here thei met the captain of an english manofwar fell in talk with him went on board hi ship and in short had so agreeabl a time that dai wa break when we came alongsid the hispaniola ben gunn wa on deck alon and as soon as we came on board he began with wonder contort to make us a confess silver wa gone the maroon had conniv at hi escap in a shore boat some hour ago and he now assur us he had onli done so to preserv our live which would certainli have been forfeit if that man with the on leg had stai aboard but thi wa not all the seacook had not gone emptyhand he had cut through a bulkhead unobserv and had remov on of the sack of coin worth perhap three or four hundr guinea to help him on hi further wander i think we were all pleas to be so cheapli quit of him well to make a long stori short we got a few hand on board made a good cruis home and the hispaniola reach bristol just as mr blandli wa begin to think of fit out her consort five men onli of those who had sail return with her drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeanc although to be sure we were not quit in so bad a case as that other ship thei sang about with on man of her crew aliv what put to sea with seventyf all of us had an ampl share of the treasur and us it wise or foolishli accord to our natur captain smollett is now retir from the sea grai not onli save hi monei but be suddenli smit with the desir to rise also studi hi profess and he is now mate and part owner of a fine fullrig ship marri besid and the father of a famili as for ben gunn he got a thousand pound which he spent or lost in three week or to be more exact in nineteen dai for he wa back beg on the twentieth then he wa given a lodg to keep exactli as he had fear upon the island and he still live a great favourit though someth of a butt with the countri boi and a notabl singer in church on sundai and saint dai of silver we have heard no more that formid seafar man with on leg ha at last gone clean out of my
