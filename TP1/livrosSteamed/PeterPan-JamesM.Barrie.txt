got it there never wa a simpler happier famili until the come of peter pan mr darl first heard of peter when she wa tidi up her children s mind it is the nightli custom of everi good mother after her children ar asleep to rummag in their mind and put thing straight for next morn repack into their proper place the mani articl that have wander dure the dai if you could keep awak but of cours you can t you would see your own mother do thi and you would find it veri interest to watch her it is quit like tidi up drawer you would see her on her knee i expect linger humor over some of your content wonder where on earth you had pick thi thing up make discoveri sweet and not so sweet press thi to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedli stow that out of sight when you wake in the morn the naughti and evil passion with which you went to bed have been fold up small and place at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifulli air ar spread out your prettier thought readi for you to put on i don t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person s mind doctor sometim draw map of other part of you and your own map can becom intens interest but catch them try to draw a map of a child s mind which is not onli confus but keep go round all the time there ar zigzag line on it just like your temperatur on a card and these ar probabl road in the island for the neverland is alwai more or less an island with astonish splash of colour here and there and coral reef and rakishlook craft in the of and savag and lone lair and gnome who ar mostli tailor and cave through which a river run and princ with six elder brother and a hut fast go to decai and on veri small old ladi with a hook nose it would be an easi map if that were all but there is also first dai at school religion father the round pond needlework murder hang verb that take the dativ chocol pud dai get into brace sai ninetynin threepenc for pull out your tooth yourself and so on and either these ar part of the island or thei ar anoth map show through and it is all rather confus especi as noth will stand still of cours the neverland vari a good deal john s for instanc had a lagoon with flamingo fly over it at which john wa shoot while michael who wa veri small had a flamingo with lagoon fly over it john live in a boat turn upsid down on the sand michael in a wigwam wendi in a hous of leav deftli sewn togeth john had no friend michael had friend at night wendi had a pet wolf forsaken by it parent but on the whole the neverland have a famili resembl and if thei stood still in a row you could sai of them that thei have each other s nose and so forth on these magic shore children at plai ar for ever beach their coracl simpl boat we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more of all delect island the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not larg and sprawli you know with tediou distanc between on adventur and anoth but nice cram when you plai at it by dai with the chair and tablecloth it is not in the least alarm but in the two minut befor you go to sleep it becom veri real that is why there ar nightlight occasion in her travel through her children s mind mr darl found thing she could not understand and of these quit the most perplex wa the word peter she knew of no peter and yet he wa here and there in john and michael s mind while wendi s began to be scrawl all over with him the name stood out in bolder letter than ani of the other word and as mr darl gaze she felt that it had an oddli cocki appear ye he is rather cocki wendi admit with regret her mother had been question her but who is he my pet he is peter pan you know mother at first mr darl did not know but after think back into her childhood she just rememb a peter pan who wa said to live with the fairi there were odd stori about him as that when children di he went part of the wai with them so that thei should not be frighten she had believ in him at the time but now that she wa marri and full of sens she quit doubt whether there wa ani such person besid she said to wendi he would be grown up by thi time oh no he isn t grown up wendi assur her confid and he is just my size she meant that he wa her size in both mind and bodi she didn t know how she knew she just knew it mr darl consult mr darl but he smile poohpooh mark my word he said it is some nonsens nana ha been put into their head just the sort of idea a dog would have leav it alon and it will blow over but it would not blow over and soon the troublesom boi gave mr darl quit a shock children have the strangest adventur without be troubl by them for instanc thei mai rememb to mention a week after the event happen that when thei were in the wood thei had met their dead father and had a game with him it wa in thi casual wai that wendi on morn made a disquiet revel some leav of a tree had been found on the nurseri floor which certainli were not there when the children went to bed and mr darl wa puzzl over them when wendi said with a toler smile i do believ it is that peter again whatev do you mean wendi it is so naughti of him not to wipe hi feet wendi said sigh she wa a tidi child she explain in quit a matteroffact wai that she thought peter sometim came to the nurseri in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and plai on hi pipe to her unfortun she never woke so she didn t know how she knew she just knew what nonsens you talk preciou no on can get into the hous without knock i think he come in by the window she said my love it is three floor up were not the leav at the foot of the window mother it wa quit true the leav had been found veri near the window mr darl did not know what to think for it all seem so natur to wendi that you could not dismiss it by sai she had been dream my child the mother cri why did you not tell me of thi befor i forgot said wendi lightli she wa in a hurri to get her breakfast oh sure she must have been dream but on the other hand there were the leav mr darl examin them veri carefulli thei were skeleton leav but she wa sure thei did not come from ani tree that grew in england she crawl about the floor peer at it with a candl for mark of a strang foot she rattl the poker up the chimnei and tap the wall she let down a tape from the window to the pavement and it wa a sheer drop of thirti feet without so much as a spout to climb up by certainli wendi had been dream but wendi had not been dream as the veri next night show the night on which the extraordinari adventur of these children mai be said to have begun on the night we speak of all the children were onc more in bed it happen to be nana s even off and mr darl had bath them and sung to them till on by on thei had let go her hand and slid awai into the land of sleep all were look so safe and cosi that she smile at her fear now and sat down tranquilli by the fire to sew it wa someth for michael who on hi birthdai wa get into shirt the fire wa warm howev and the nurseri dimli lit by three nightlight and present the sew lai on mr darl s lap then her head nod oh so gracefulli she wa asleep look at the four of them wendi and michael over there john here and mr darl by the fire there should have been a fourth nightlight while she slept she had a dream she dreamt that the neverland had come too near and that a strang boi had broken through from it he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him befor in the face of mani women who have no children perhap he is to be found in the face of some mother also but in her dream he had rent the film that obscur the neverland and she saw wendi and john and michael peep through the gap the dream by itself would have been a trifl but while she wa dream the window of the nurseri blew open and a boi did drop on the floor he wa accompani by a strang light no bigger than your fist which dart about the room like a live thing and i think it must have been thi light that waken mr darl she start up with a cry and saw the boi and somehow she knew at onc that he wa peter pan if you or i or wendi had been there we should have seen that he wa veri like mr darl s kiss he wa a love boi clad in skeleton leav and the juic that ooz out of tree but the most entranc thing about him wa that he had all hi first teeth when he saw she wa a grownup he gnash the littl pearl at her chapter the shadow mr darl scream and as if in answer to a bell the door open and nana enter return from her even out she growl and sprang at the boi who leapt lightli through the window again mr darl scream thi time in distress for him for she thought he wa kill and she ran down into the street to look for hi littl bodi but it wa not there and she look up and in the black night she could see noth but what she thought wa a shoot star she return to the nurseri and found nana with someth in her mouth which prove to be the boi s shadow as he leapt at the window nana had close it quickli too late to catch him but hi shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snap it off you mai be sure mr darl examin the shadow carefulli but it wa quit the ordinari kind nana had no doubt of what wa the best thing to do with thi shadow she hung it out at the window mean he is sure to come back for it let us put it where he can get it easili without disturb the children but unfortun mr darl could not leav it hang out at the window it look so like the wash and lower the whole tone of the hous she thought of show it to mr darl but he wa tot up winter greatcoat for john and michael with a wet towel around hi head to keep hi brain clear and it seem a shame to troubl him besid she knew exactli what he would sai it all come of have a dog for a nurs she decid to roll the shadow up and put it awai carefulli in a drawer until a fit opportun came for tell her husband ah me the opportun came a week later on that nevertobeforgotten fridai of cours it wa a fridai i ought to have been special care on a fridai she

to let go but he did it and immedi he wa born across the room i flew he scream while still in midair john let go and met wendi near the bathroom oh love oh rip look at me look at me look at me thei were not nearli so eleg as peter thei could not help kick a littl but their head were bob against the ceil and there is almost noth so delici as that peter gave wendi a hand at first but had to desist tink wa so indign up and down thei went and round and round heavenli wa wendi s word i sai cri john why shouldn t we all go out of cours it wa to thi that peter had been lure them michael wa readi he want to see how long it took him to do a billion mile but wendi hesit mermaid said peter again oo and there ar pirat pirat cri john seiz hi sundai hat let us go at onc it wa just at thi moment that mr and mr darl hurri with nana out of thei ran into the middl of the street to look up at the nurseri window and ye it wa still shut but the room wa ablaz with light and most heartgrip sight of all thei could see in shadow on the curtain three littl figur in night attir circl round and round not on the floor but in the air not three figur four in a trembl thei open the street door mr darl would have rush upstair but mr darl sign him to go softli she even tri to make her heart go softli will thei reach the nurseri in time if so how delight for them and we shall all breath a sigh of relief but there will be no stori on the other hand if thei ar not in time i solemnli promis that it will all come right in the end thei would have reach the nurseri in time had it not been that the littl star were watch them onc again the star blew the window open and that smallest star of all call out cave peter then peter knew that there wa not a moment to lose come he cri imperi and soar out at onc into the night follow by john and michael and wendi mr and mr darl and nana rush into the nurseri too late the bird were flown chapter the flight second to the right and straight on till morn that peter had told wendi wa the wai to the neverland but even bird carri map and consult them at windi corner could not have sight it with these instruct peter you see just said anyth that came into hi head at first hi companion trust him implicitli and so great were the delight of fly that thei wast time circl round church spire or ani other tall object on the wai that took their fanci john and michael race michael get a start thei recal with contempt that not so long ago thei had thought themselv fine fellow for be abl to fly round a room not long ago but how long ago thei were fly over the sea befor thi thought began to disturb wendi serious john thought it wa their second sea and their third night sometim it wa dark and sometim light and now thei were veri cold and again too warm did thei realli feel hungri at time or were thei mere pretend becaus peter had such a jolli new wai of feed them hi wai wa to pursu bird who had food in their mouth suitabl for human and snatch it from them then the bird would follow and snatch it back and thei would all go chase each other gaili for mile part at last with mutual express of goodwil but wendi notic with gentl concern that peter did not seem to know that thi wa rather an odd wai of get your bread and butter nor even that there ar other wai certainli thei did not pretend to be sleepi thei were sleepi and that wa a danger for the moment thei pop off down thei fell the aw thing wa that peter thought thi funni there he goe again he would cry gleefulli as michael suddenli drop like a stone save him save him cri wendi look with horror at the cruel sea far below eventu peter would dive through the air and catch michael just befor he could strike the sea and it wa love the wai he did it but he alwai wait till the last moment and you felt it wa hi clever that interest him and not the save of human life also he wa fond of varieti and the sport that engross him on moment would suddenli ceas to engag him so there wa alwai the possibl that the next time you fell he would let you go he could sleep in the air without fall by mere ly on hi back and float but thi wa partli at least becaus he wa so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster do be more polit to him wendi whisper to john when thei were plai follow my leader then tell him to stop show off said john when plai follow my leader peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark s tail in pass just as in the street you mai run your finger along an iron rail thei could not follow him in thi with much success so perhap it wa rather like show off especi as he kept look behind to see how mani tail thei miss you must be nice to him wendi impress on her brother what could we do if he were to leav us we could go back michael said how could we ever find our wai back without him well then we could go on said john that is the aw thing john we should have to go on for we don t know how to stop thi wa true peter had forgotten to show them how to stop john said that if the worst came to the worst all thei had to do wa to go straight on for the world wa round and so in time thei must come back to their own window and who is to get food for us john i nip a bit out of that eagl s mouth pretti neatli wendi after the twentieth try wendi remind him and even though we becam good at pick up food see how we bump against cloud and thing if he is not near to give us a hand inde thei were constantli bump thei could now fly strongli though thei still kick far too much but if thei saw a cloud in front of them the more thei tri to avoid it the more certainli did thei bump into it if nana had been with them she would have had a bandag round michael s forehead by thi time peter wa not with them for the moment and thei felt rather lone up there by themselv he could go so much faster than thei that he would suddenli shoot out of sight to have some adventur in which thei had no share he would come down laugh over someth fearfulli funni he had been sai to a star but he had alreadi forgotten what it wa or he would come up with mermaid scale still stick to him and yet not be abl to sai for certain what had been happen it wa realli rather irrit to children who had never seen a mermaid and if he forget them so quickli wendi argu how can we expect that he will go on rememb us inde sometim when he return he did not rememb them at least not well wendi wa sure of it she saw recognit come into hi ey as he wa about to pass them the time of dai and go on onc even she had to call him by name i m wendi she said agitatedli he wa veri sorri i sai wendi he whisper to her alwai if you see me forget you just keep on sai i m wendi and then i ll rememb of cours thi wa rather unsatisfactori howev to make amend he show them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that wa go their wai and thi wa such a pleasant chang that thei tri it sever time and found that thei could sleep thu with secur inde thei would have slept longer but peter tire quickli of sleep and soon he would cry in hi captain voic we get off here so with occasion tiff but on the whole rollick thei drew near the neverland for after mani moon thei did reach it and what is more thei had been go pretti straight all the time not perhap so much ow to the guidanc of peter or tink as becaus the island wa look for them it is onli thu that ani on mai sight those magic shore there it is said peter calmli where where where all the arrow ar point inde a million golden arrow were point it out to the children all direct by their friend the sun who want them to be sure of their wai befor leav them for the night wendi and john and michael stood on tipto in the air to get their first sight of the island strang to sai thei all recogn it at onc and until fear fell upon them thei hail it not as someth long dreamt of and seen at last but as a familiar friend to whom thei were return home for the holidai john there s the lagoon wendi look at the turtl buri their egg in the sand i sai john i see your flamingo with the broken leg look michael there s your cave john what s that in the brushwood it s a wolf with her whelp wendi i do believ that s your littl whelp there s my boat john with her side stove in no it isn t why we burn your boat that s her at ani rate i sai john i see the smoke of the redskin camp where show me and i ll tell you by the wai smoke curl whether thei ar on the warpath there just across the mysteri river i see now ye thei ar on the warpath right enough peter wa a littl annoi with them for know so much but if he want to lord it over them hi triumph wa at hand for have i not told you that anon fear fell upon them it came as the arrow went leav the island in gloom in the old dai at home the neverland had alwai begun to look a littl dark and threaten by bedtim then unexplor patch aros in it and spread black shadow move about in them the roar of the beast of prei wa quit differ now and abov all you lost the certainti that you would win you were quit glad that the nightlight were on you even like nana to sai that thi wa just the mantelpiec over here and that the neverland wa all makebeliev of cours the neverland had been makebeliev in those dai but it wa real now and there were no nightlight and it wa get darker everi moment and where wa nana thei had been fly apart but thei huddl close to peter now hi careless manner had gone at last hi ey were sparkl and a tingl went through them everi time thei touch hi bodi thei were now over the fearsom island fly so low that sometim a tree graze their feet noth horrid wa visibl in the air yet their progress had becom slow and labour exactli as if thei were push their wai through hostil forc sometim thei hung in the air until peter had beaten on it with hi fist thei don t want us to land he explain who ar thei wendi whisper shudder but he could not or would not sai tinker bell had been asleep on hi shoulder but now he waken her and sent her on in front sometim he pois himself in the air listen intent with hi hand to hi ear and again he would stare down with ey so bright that thei seem to bore two hole to earth have done these thing he went on again hi courag wa almost appal would you like an adventur now he said casual to john or would you like to have your tea first wendi said tea first quickli and michael press her hand in gratitud but the braver john hesit what kind of adventur he ask cautious there s a pirat asleep in the pampa just beneath us peter told him if you like we ll go down and kill him i don t see him john said after a long paus i do suppos john said a littl huskili he were to wake up peter spoke indignantli you don t think i would kill him while he wa sleep i would wake him first and then kill him that s the wai i alwai do i sai do you kill mani ton john said how rip but decid to have tea first he ask if there were mani pirat on the island just now and peter said he had never known so mani who is captain now hook answer peter and hi face becam veri stern as he said that hate word ja hook ay then inde michael began to cry and even john could speak in gulp onli for thei knew hook s reput he wa blackbeard s bo sun john whisper huskili he is the worst of them all he is the onli man of whom barbecu wa afraid that s him said peter what is he like is he big he is not so big as he wa how do you mean i cut off a bit of him you ye me said peter sharpli i wasn t mean to be disrespect oh all right but i sai what bit hi right hand then he can t fight now oh can t he just lefthand he ha an iron hook instead of a right hand and he claw with it claw i sai john said peter ye sai ay ay sir ay ay sir there is on thing peter continu that everi boi who serv under me ha to promis and so must you john pale it is thi if we meet hook in open fight you must leav him to me i promis john said loyal for the moment thei were feel less eeri becaus tink wa fly with them and in her light thei could distinguish each other unfortun she could not fly so slowli as thei and so she had to go round and round them in a circl in which thei move as in a halo wendi quit like it until peter point out the drawback she tell me he said that the pirat sight us befor the dark came and got long tom out the big gun ye and of cours thei must see her light and if thei guess we ar near it thei ar sure to let fly wendi john michael tell her to go awai at onc peter the three cri simultan but he refus she think we have lost the wai he repli stiffli and she is rather frighten you don t think i would send her awai all by herself when she is frighten for a moment the circl of light wa broken and someth gave peter a love littl pinch then tell her wendi beg to put out her light she can t put it out that is about the onli thing fairi can t do it just goe out of itself when she fall asleep same as the star then tell her to sleep at onc john almost order she can t sleep except when she s sleepi it is the onli other thing fairi can t do seem to me growl john these ar the onli two thing worth do here he got a pinch but not a love on if onli on of us had a pocket peter said we could carri her in it howev thei had set off in such a hurri that there wa not a pocket between the four of them he had a happi idea john s hat tink agre to travel by hat if it wa carri in the hand john carri it though she had hope to be carri by peter present wendi took the hat becaus john said it struck against hi knee as he flew and thi as we shall see led to mischief for tinker bell hate to be under an oblig to wendi in the black topper the light wa complet hidden and thei flew on in silenc it wa the stillest silenc thei had ever known broken onc by a distant lap which peter explain wa the wild beast drink at the ford and again by a rasp sound that might have been the branch of tree rub togeth but he said it wa the redskin sharpen their knive even these nois ceas to michael the loneli wa dread if onli someth would make a sound he cri as if in answer to hi request the air wa rent by the most tremend crash he had ever heard the pirat had fire long tom at them the roar of it echo through the mountain and the echo seem to cry savag where ar thei where ar thei where ar thei thu sharpli did the terrifi three learn the differ between an island of makebeliev and the same island come true when at last the heaven were steadi again john and michael found themselv alon in the dark john wa tread the air mechan and michael without know how to float wa float ar you shot john whisper tremul i haven t tri myself out yet michael whisper back we know now that no on had been hit peter howev had been carri by the wind of the shot far out to sea while wendi wa blown upward with no companion but tinker bell it would have been well for wendi if at that moment she had drop the hat i don t know whether the idea came suddenli to tink or whether she had plan it on the wai but she at onc pop out of the hat and began to lure wendi to her destruct tink wa not all bad or rather she wa all bad just now but on the other hand sometim she wa all good fairi have to be on thing or the other becaus be so small thei unfortun have room for on feel onli at a time thei ar howev allow to chang onli it must be a complet chang at present she wa full of jealousi of wendi what she said in her love tinkl wendi could not of cours understand and i believ some of it wa bad word but it sound kind and she flew back and forward plainli mean follow me and all will be well what els could poor wendi do she call to peter and john and michael and got onli mock echo in repli she did not yet know that tink hate her with the fierc hatr of a veri woman and so bewild and now stagger in her flight she follow tink to her doom chapter the island come true feel that peter wa on hi wai back the neverland had again woke into life we ought to us the pluperfect and sai waken but woke is better and wa alwai us by peter in hi absenc thing ar usual quiet on the island the fairi take an hour longer in the morn the beast attend to their young the redskin feed heavili for six dai and night and when pirat and lost boi meet thei mere bite their thumb at each other but with the come of peter who hate lethargi thei ar under wai again if you put your ear to the ground now you would hear the whole island seeth with life on thi even the chief forc of the island were dispos as follow the lost boi were out look for peter the pirat were out look for the lost boi the redskin were out look for the pirat and the beast were out look for the redskin thei were go round and round the island but thei did not meet becaus all were go at the same rate all want blood except the boi who like it as a rule but tonight were out to greet their captain the boi on the island vari of cours in number accord as thei get kill and so on and when thei seem to be grow up which is against the rule peter thin them out but at thi time there were six of them count the twin as two let us pretend to lie here among the sugarcan and watch them as thei steal by in singl file each with hi hand on hi dagger thei ar forbidden by peter to look in the least like him and thei wear the skin of the bear slain by themselv in which thei ar so round and furri that when thei fall thei roll thei have therefor becom veri surefoot the first to pass is tootl not the least brave but the most unfortun of all that gallant band he had been in fewer adventur than ani of them becaus the big thing constantli happen just when he had step round the corner all would be quiet he would take the opportun of go off to gather a few stick for firewood and then when he return the other would be sweep up the blood thi illluck had given a gentl melancholi to hi counten but instead of sour hi natur had sweeten it so that he wa quit the humblest of the boi poor kind tootl there is danger in the air for you tonight take care lest an adventur is now offer you which if accept will plung you in

time he fell asleep and some unsteadi fairi had to climb over him on their wai home from an orgi ani of the other boi obstruct the fairi path at night thei would have mischief but thei just tweak peter s nose and pass on chapter the home under the ground on of the first thing peter did next dai wa to measur wendi and john and michael for hollow tree hook you rememb had sneer at the boi for think thei need a tree apiec but thi wa ignor for unless your tree fit you it wa difficult to go up and down and no two of the boi were quit the same size onc you fit you drew in let out your breath at the top and down you went at exactli the right speed while to ascend you drew in and let out altern and so wriggl up of cours when you have master the action you ar abl to do these thing without think of them and noth can be more grace but you simpli must fit and peter measur you for your tree as carefulli as for a suit of cloth the onli differ be that the cloth ar made to fit you while you have to be made to fit the tree usual it is done quit easili as by your wear too mani garment or too few but if you ar bumpi in awkward place or the onli avail tree is an odd shape peter doe some thing to you and after that you fit onc you fit great care must be taken to go on fit and thi as wendi wa to discov to her delight keep a whole famili in perfect condit wendi and michael fit their tree at the first try but john had to be alter a littl after a few dai practic thei could go up and down as gaili as bucket in a well and how ardent thei grew to love their home under the ground especi wendi it consist of on larg room as all hous should do with a floor in which you could dig for worm if you want to go fish and in thi floor grew stout mushroom of a charm colour which were us as stool a never tree tri hard to grow in the centr of the room but everi morn thei saw the trunk through level with the floor by teatim it wa alwai about two feet high and then thei put a door on top of it the whole thu becom a tabl as soon as thei clear awai thei saw off the trunk again and thu there wa more room to plai there wa an enorm fireplac which wa in almost ani part of the room where you care to light it and across thi wendi stretch string made of fibr from which she suspend her wash the bed wa tilt against the wall by dai and let down at when it fill nearli half the room and all the boi slept in it except michael ly like sardin in a tin there wa a strict rule against turn round until on gave the signal when all turn at onc michael should have us it also but wendi would have desir a babi and he wa the littlest and you know what women ar and the short and long of it is that he wa hung up in a basket it wa rough and simpl and not unlik what babi bear would have made of an underground hous in the same circumst but there wa on recess in the wall no larger than a birdcag which wa the privat apart of tinker bell it could be shut off from the rest of the hous by a tini curtain which tink who wa most fastidi particular alwai kept drawn when dress or undress no woman howev larg could have had a more exquisit boudoir dress room and bedchamb combin the couch as she

knew whether there would be a real meal or just a makebeliev it all depend upon peter s whim he could eat realli eat if it wa part of a game but he could not stodg cram down the food just to feel stodgi stuf with food which is what most children like better than anyth els the next best thing be to talk about it makebeliev wa so real to him that dure a meal of it you could see him get rounder of cours it wa try but you simpli had to follow hi lead and if you could prove to him that you were get loos for your tree he let you stodg wendi s favourit time for sew and darn wa after thei had all

window open for her to fly back by and thi gave her complet eas of mind what did disturb her at time wa that john rememb hi parent vagu onli as peopl he had onc known while michael wa quit will to believ that she wa realli hi mother these thing scare her a littl and nobli anxiou to do her duti she tri to fix the old life in their mind by set them examin paper on it as like as possibl to the on she us to do at school the other boi thought thi awfulli interest and insist on join and thei made slate for themselv and sat round the tabl write and think hard about the question she had written on anoth slate and pass round thei were the most ordinari question what wa the colour of mother s ey which wa taller father or mother wa mother blond or brunett answer all three question if possibl a write an essai of not less than word on how i spent my last holidai or the charact of father and mother compar onli on of these to be attempt or describ mother s laugh describ father s laugh describ mother s parti dress describ the kennel and it inmat thei were just everydai question like these and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross and it wa realli dread what a number of cross even john made of cours the onli boi who repli to everi question wa slightli and no on could have been more hope of come out first but hi answer were perfectli ridicul and he realli came out last a melancholi thing peter did not compet for on thing he despis all mother except wendi and for anoth he wa the onli boi on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word he wa abov all that sort of thing by the wai the question were all written in the past tens what wa the colour of mother s ey and so on wendi you see had been forget too adventur of cours as we shall see were of daili occurr but about thi time peter invent with wendi s help a new game that fascin him enorm until he suddenli had no more interest in it which as you have been told wa what alwai happen with hi game it consist in pretend not to have adventur in do the sort of thing john and michael had been do all their live sit on stool fling ball in the air push each other go out for walk and come back without have kill so much as a grizzli to see peter do noth on a stool wa a great sight he could not help look solemn at such time to sit still seem to him such a comic thing to do he boast that he had gone walk for the good of hi health for sever sun these were the most novel of all adventur to him and john and michael had to pretend to be delight also otherwis he would have treat them sever he often went out alon and when he came back you were never absolut certain whether he had had an adventur or not he might have forgotten it so complet that he said noth about it and then when you went out you found the bodi and on the other hand he might sai a great deal about it and yet you could not find the bodi sometim he came home with hi head bandag and then wendi coo over him and bath it in lukewarm water while he told a dazzl tale but she wa never quit sure you know there were howev mani adventur which she knew to be true becaus she wa in them herself and there were still more that were at least partli true for the other boi were in them and said thei were wholli true to describ them all would requir a book as larg as an englishlatin latinenglish dictionari and the most we can do is to give on as a specimen of an averag hour on the island the difficulti is which on to choos should we take the brush with the redskin at slightli gulch it wa a sanguinari affair and especi interest as show on of peter s peculiar which wa that in the middl of a fight he would suddenli chang side at the gulch when victori wa still in the balanc sometim lean thi wai and sometim that he call out i m redskin todai what ar you tootl and tootl answer redskin what ar you nib and nib said redskin what ar you twin and so on and thei were all redskin and of cours thi would have end the fight had not the real redskin fascin by peter s method agre to be lost boi for that onc and so at it thei all went again more fierc than ever the extraordinari upshot of thi adventur wasbut we have not decid yet that thi is the adventur we ar to narrat perhap a better on would be the night attack by the redskin on the hous under the ground when sever of them stuck in the hollow tree and had to be pull out like cork or we might tell how peter save tiger lili s life in the mermaid lagoon and so made her hi alli or we could tell of that cake the pirat cook so that the boi might eat it and perish and how thei place it in on cun spot after anoth but alwai wendi snatch it from the hand of her children so that in time it lost it succul and becam as hard as a stone and wa us as a missil and hook fell over it in the dark or suppos we tell of the bird that were peter s friend particularli of the never bird that built in a tree overhang the lagoon and how the nest fell into the water and still the bird sat on her egg and peter gave order that she wa not to be disturb that is a pretti stori and the end show how grate a bird can be but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventur of the lagoon which would of cours be tell two adventur rather than just on a shorter adventur and quit as excit wa tinker bell s attempt with the help of some street fairi to have the sleep wendi convei on a great float leaf to the mainland fortun the leaf gave wai and wendi woke think it wa bathtim and swam back or again we might choos peter s defianc of the lion when he drew a circl round him on the ground with an arrow and dare them to cross it and though he wait for hour with the other boi and wendi look on breathlessli from tree not on of them dare to accept hi challeng which of these adventur shall we choos the best wai will be to toss for it i have toss and the lagoon ha won thi almost make on wish that the gulch or the cake or tink s leaf had won of cours i could do it again and make it best out of three howev perhap fairest to stick to the lagoon chapter the mermaid lagoon if you shut your ey and ar a lucki on you mai see at time a shapeless pool of love pale colour suspend in the dark then if you squeez your ey tighter the pool begin to take shape and the colour becom so vivid that with anoth squeez thei must go on fire but just befor thei go on fire you see the lagoon thi is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland just on heavenli moment if there could be two moment you might see the surf and hear the mermaid sing the children often spent long summer dai on thi lagoon swim or float most of the time plai the mermaid game in the water and so forth you must not think from thi that the mermaid were on friendli term with them on the contrari it wa among wendi s last regret that all the time she wa on the island she never had a civil word from on of them when she stole softli to the edg of the lagoon she might see them by the score especi on maroon rock where thei love to bask comb out their hair in a lazi wai that quit irrit her or she might even swim on tipto as it were to within a yard of them but then thei saw her and dive probabl splash her with their tail not by accid but intention thei treat all the boi in the same wai except of cours peter who chat with them on maroon rock by the hour and sat on their tail when thei got cheeki he gave wendi on of their comb the most haunt time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon when thei utter strang wail cri but the lagoon is danger for mortal then and until the even of which we have now to tell wendi had never seen the lagoon by moonlight less from fear for of cours peter would have accompani her than becaus she had strict rule about everi on be in bed by seven she wa often at the lagoon howev on sunni dai after rain when the mermaid come up in extraordinari number to plai with their bubbl the bubbl of mani colour made in rainbow water thei treat as ball hit them gaili from on to anoth with their tail and try to keep them in the rainbow till thei burst the goal ar at each end of the rainbow and the keeper onli ar allow to us their hand sometim a dozen of these game will be go on in the lagoon at a time and it is quit a pretti sight but the moment the children tri to join in thei had to plai by themselv for the mermaid immedi disappear nevertheless we have proof that thei secretli watch the interlop and were not abov take an idea from them for john introduc a new wai of hit the bubbl with the head instead of the hand and the mermaid adopt it thi is the on mark that john ha left on the neverland it must also have been rather pretti to see the children rest on a rock for half an hour after their middai meal wendi insist on their do thi and it had to be a real rest even though the meal wa makebeliev so thei lai there in the sun and their bodi glisten in it while she sat besid them and look import it wa on such dai and thei were all on maroon rock the rock wa not much larger than their great bed but of cours thei all knew how not to take up much room and thei were doze or at least ly with their ey shut and pinch occasion when thei thought wendi wa not look she wa veri busi stitch while she stitch a chang came to the lagoon littl shiver ran over it and the sun went awai and shadow stole across the water turn it cold wendi could no longer see to thread her needl and when she look up the lagoon that had alwai hitherto been such a laugh place seem formid and unfriendli it wa not she knew that night had come but someth as dark as night had come no wors than that it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to sai that it wa come what wa it there crowd upon her all the stori she had been told of maroon rock so call becaus evil captain put sailor on it and leav them there to drown thei drown when the tide rise for then it is submerg of cours she should have rous the children at onc not mere becaus of the unknown that wa stalk toward them but becaus it wa no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilli but she wa a young mother and she did not know thi she thought you simpli must stick to your rule about half an hour after the middai meal so though fear wa upon her and she long to hear male voic she would not waken them even when she heard the sound of muffl oar though her heart wa in her mouth she did not waken them she stood over them to let them have their sleep out wa it not brave of wendi it wa well for those boi then that there wa on among them who could sniff danger even in hi sleep peter sprang erect as wide awak at onc as a dog and with on warn cry he rous the other he stood motionless on hand to hi ear pirat he cri the other came closer to him a strang smile wa plai about hi face and wendi saw it and shudder while that smile wa on hi face no on dare address him all thei could do wa to stand readi to obei the order came sharp and incis dive there wa a gleam of leg and instantli the lagoon seem desert maroon rock stood alon in the forbid water as if it were itself maroon the boat drew nearer it wa the pirat dinghi with three figur in her smee and starkei and the third a captiv no other than tiger lili her hand and ankl were ti and she knew what wa to be her fate she wa to be left on the rock to perish an end to on of her race more terribl than death by fire or tortur for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happi huntingground yet her face wa impass she wa the daughter of a chief she must die as a chief s daughter it is enough thei had caught her board the pirat ship with a knife in her mouth no watch wa kept on the ship it be hook s boast that the wind of hi name guard the ship for a mile around now her fate would help to guard it also on more wail would go the round in that wind by night in the gloom that thei brought with them the two pirat did not see the rock till thei crash into it luff you lubber cri an irish voic that wa smee s here s the rock now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leav her here to drown it wa the work of on brutal moment to land the beauti girl on the rock she wa too proud to offer a vain resist quit near the rock but out of sight two head were bob up and down peter s and wendi s wendi wa cry for it wa the first tragedi she had seen peter had seen mani tragedi but he had forgotten them all he wa less sorri than wendi for tiger lili it wa two against on that anger him and he meant to save her an easi wai would have been to wait until the pirat had gone but he wa never on to choos the easi wai there wa almost noth he could not do and he now imit the voic of hook ahoi there you lubber he call it wa a marvel imit the captain said the pirat stare at each other in surpris he must be swim out to us starkei said when thei had look for him in vain we ar put the redskin on the rock smee call out set her free came the astonish answer free ye cut her bond and let her go but captain at onc d ye hear cri peter or i ll plung my hook in you thi is queer smee gasp better do what the captain order said starkei nervous ay ay smee

crow and thu betrai himself so at onc her hand went out to cover hi mouth but it wa stai even in the act for boat ahoi rang over the lagoon in hook s voic and thi time it wa not peter who had spoken peter mai have been about to crow but hi face pucker in a whistl of surpris instead boat ahoi again came the voic now wendi understood the real hook wa also in the water he wa swim to the boat and as hi men show a light to guid him he had soon reach them in the light of the lantern wendi saw hi hook grip the boat s side she saw hi evil swarthi face as he rose drip from the water and quak she would have like to swim awai but peter would not budg he wa tingl with life and also topheavi with conceit am i not a wonder oh i am a wonder he whisper to her and though she thought so also she wa realli glad for the sake of hi reput that no on heard him except herself he sign to her to listen the two pirat were veri curiou to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with hi head on hi hook in a posit of profound melancholi captain is all well thei ask timidli but he answer with a hollow moan he sigh said smee he sigh again said starkei and yet a third time he sigh said smee then at last he spoke passion the game s up he cri those boi have found a mother affright though she wa wendi swell with pride o evil dai cri starkei what s a mother ask the ignor smee wendi wa so shock that

simultan came the gai voic of peter ar you readi boi ay ay from variou part of the lagoon then lam into the pirat the fight wa short and sharp first to draw blood wa john who gallantli climb into the boat and held starkei there wa fierc struggl in which the cutlass wa torn from the pirat s grasp he wriggl overboard and john leapt after him the dinghi drift awai here and there a head bob up in the water and there wa a flash of steel follow by a cry or a whoop in the confus some struck at their own side the corkscrew of smee got tootl in the fourth rib but he wa himself pink nick in turn by curli farther from the rock starkei wa press slightli and the twin hard where all thi time wa peter he wa seek bigger game the other were all brave boi and thei must not be blame for back from the pirat captain hi iron claw made a circl of dead water round him from which thei fled like affright fish but there wa on who did not fear him there wa on prepar to enter that circl strang it wa not in the water that thei met hook rose to the rock to breath and at the same moment peter scale it on the opposit side the rock wa slipperi as a ball and thei had to crawl rather than climb neither knew that the other wa come each feel for a grip met the other s arm in surpris thei rais their head their face were almost touch so thei met some of the greatest hero have confess that just befor thei fell to began combat thei had a sink feel in the stomach had it been so with peter at that moment i would admit it after all he wa the onli man that the seacook had fear but peter had no sink he had on feel onli glad and he gnash hi pretti teeth with joi quick as thought he snatch a knife from hook s belt and wa about to drive it home when he saw that he wa higher up the rock than hi foe it would not have been fight fair he gave the pirat a hand to help him up it wa then that hook bit him not the pain of thi but it unfair wa what daze peter it made him quit helpless he could onli stare horrifi everi child is affect thu the first time he is treat unfairli all he think he ha a right to when he come to you to be your is fair after you have been unfair to him he will love you again but will never afterward be quit the same boi no on ever get over the first unfair no on except peter he often met it but he alwai forgot it i suppos that wa the real differ between him and all the rest so when he met it now it wa like the first time and he could just stare helpless twice the iron hand claw him a few moment afterward the other boi saw hook in the water strike wildli for the ship no elat on the pestil face now onli white fear for the crocodil wa in dog pursuit of him on ordinari occas the boi would have swum alongsid cheer but now thei were uneasi for thei had lost both peter and wendi and were scour the lagoon for them call them by name thei found the dinghi and went home in it shout peter wendi as thei went but no answer came save mock laughter from the mermaid thei must be swim back or fly the boi conclud thei were not veri anxiou becaus thei had such faith in peter thei chuckl boylik becaus thei would be late for bed and it wa all mother wendi s fault when their voic di awai there came cold silenc over the lagoon and then a feebl cry help help two small figur were beat against the rock the girl had faint and lai on the boi s arm with a last effort peter pull her up the rock and then lai down besid her even as he also faint he saw that the water wa rise he knew that thei would soon be drown but he could do no more as thei lai side by side a mermaid caught wendi by the feet and began pull her softli into the water peter feel her slip from him woke with a start and wa just in time to draw her back but he had to tell her the truth we ar on the rock wendi he said but it is grow smaller soon the water will be over it she did not understand even now we must go she said almost brightli ye he answer faintli shall we swim or fly peter he had to tell her do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island wendi without my help she had to admit that she wa too tire he moan what is it she ask anxiou about him at onc i can t help you wendi hook wound me i can neither fly nor swim do you mean we shall both be drown look how the water is rise thei put their hand over their ey to shut out the sight thei thought thei would soon be no more as thei sat thu someth brush against peter as light as a kiss and stai there as if sai timidli can i be of ani us it wa the tail of a kite which michael had made some dai befor it had torn itself out of hi hand and float awai michael s kite peter said without interest but next moment he had seiz the tail and wa pull the kite toward him it lift michael off the ground he cri why should it not carri you both of us it can t lift two michael and curli tri let us draw lot wendi said brave and you a ladi never alreadi he had ti the tail round her she clung to him she refus to go without him but with a goodby wendi he push her from the rock and in a few minut she wa born out of hi sight peter wa alon on the lagoon the rock wa veri small now soon it would be submerg pale rai of light tipto across the water and by and by there wa to be heard a sound at onc the most music and the most melancholi in the world the mermaid call to the moon peter wa not quit like other boi but he wa afraid at last a tremour ran through him like a shudder pass over the sea but on the sea on shudder follow anoth till there ar hundr of them and peter felt just the on next moment he wa stand erect on the rock again with that smile on hi face and a drum beat within him it wa sai to die will be an awfulli big adventur chapter the never bird the last sound peter heard befor he wa quit alon were the mermaid retir on by on to their bedchamb under the sea he wa too far awai to hear their door shut but everi door in the coral cave where thei live ring a tini bell when it open or close as in all the nicest hous on the mainland and he heard the bell steadili the water rose till thei were nibbl at hi feet and to pass the time until thei made their final gulp he watch the onli thing on the lagoon he thought it wa a piec of float paper perhap part of the kite and wonder idli how long it would take to drift ashor present he notic as an odd thing that it wa undoubtedli out upon the lagoon with some definit purpos for it wa fight the tide and sometim win and when it won peter alwai sympathet to the weaker side could not help clap it wa such a gallant piec of paper it wa not realli a piec of paper it wa the never bird make desper effort to reach peter on the nest by work her wing in a wai she had learn sinc the nest fell into the water she wa abl to some extent to guid her strang craft but by the time peter recognis her she wa veri exhaust she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were egg in it i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometim torment her i can suppos onli that like mr darl and the rest of them she wa melt becaus he had all hi first teeth she call out to him what she had come for and he call out to her what she wa do there but of cours neither of them understood the other s languag in fanci stori peopl can talk to the bird freeli and i wish for the moment i could pretend that thi were such a stori and sai that peter repli intellig to the never bird but truth is best and i want to tell you onli what realli happen well not onli could thei not understand each other but thei forgot their manner iwantyoutogetintothenest the bird call speak as slowli and distinctli as possibl andthenyoucandriftashor butiamtootiredtobringitanynearersoyoumusttri toswimtoit what ar you quack about peter answer why don t you let the nest drift as usual iwanty the bird said and repeat it all over then peter tri slow and distinct whatareyouquackingabout and so on the never bird becam irrit thei have veri short temper you dunderhead littl jai she scream why don t you do as i tell you peter felt that she wa call him name and at a ventur he retort hotli so ar you then rather curious thei both snap out the same remark shut up shut up nevertheless the bird wa determin to save him if she could and by on last mighti effort she propel the nest against the rock then up she flew desert her egg so as to make her mean clear then at last he understood and clutch the nest and wave hi thank to the bird as she flutter overhead it wa not to receiv hi thank howev that she hung there in the sky it wa not even to watch him get into the nest it wa to see what he did with her egg there were two larg white egg and peter lift them up and reflect the bird cover her face with her wing so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peep between the feather i forget whether i have told you that there wa a stave on the rock driven into it by some buccan of long ago to mark the site of buri treasur the children had discov the glitter hoard and when in a mischiev mood us to fling shower of moidor diamond pearl and piec of eight to the gull who pounc upon them for food and then flew awai rage at the scurvi trick that had been plai upon them the stave wa still there and on it starkei had hung hi hat a deep tarpaulin watertight with a broad brim peter put the egg into thi hat and set it on the lagoon it float beautifulli the never bird saw at onc what he wa up to and scream her admir of him and ala peter crow hi agreement with her then he got into the nest rear the stave in it as a mast and hung up hi shirt for a sail at the same moment the bird flutter down upon the hat and onc more sat snugli on her egg she drift in on direct and he wa born off in anoth both cheer of cours when peter land he beach hi barqu small ship actual the never bird s nest in thi particular case in point in a place where the bird would easili find it but the hat wa such a great success that she abandon the nest it drift about till it went to piec and often starkei came to the shore of the lagoon and with mani bitter feel watch the bird sit on hi hat as we shall not see her again it mai be worth mention here that all never bird now build in that shape of nest with a broad brim on which the youngster take an air great were the rejoic when peter reach the home under the ground almost as soon as wendi who had been carri hither and thither by the kite everi boi had adventur to tell but perhap the biggest adventur of all wa that thei were sever hour late for bed thi so inflat them that thei did variou dodgi thing to get stai up still longer such as demand bandag but wendi though glori in have them all home again safe and sound wa scandalis by the late of the hour and cri to bed to bed in a voic that had to be obei next dai howev she wa awfulli tender and gave out bandag to everi on and thei plai till bedtim at limp about and carri their arm in sling chapter the happi home on import result of the brush with the pirat on the lagoon wa that it made the redskin their friend peter had save tiger lili from a dread fate and now there wa noth she and her brave would not do for him all night thei sat abov keep watch over the home under the ground and await the big attack by the pirat which obvious could not be much longer delai even by dai thei hung about smoke the pipe of peac and look almost as if thei want titbit to eat thei call peter the great white father prostrat themselv ly down befor him and he like thi tremend so that it wa not realli good for him the great white father he would sai to them in a veri lordli manner as thei grovel at hi feet is glad to see the piccaninni warrior protect hi wigwam from the pirat me tiger lili that love creatur would repli peter pan save me me hi velli nice friend me no let pirat hurt him she wa far too pretti to cring in thi wai but peter thought it hi due and he would answer condescendingli it is good peter pan ha spoken alwai when he said peter pan ha spoken it meant that thei must now shut up and thei accept it humbl in that spirit but thei were by no mean so respect to the other boi whom thei look upon as just ordinari brave thei said howdo to them and thing like that and what annoi the boi wa that peter seem to think thi all right secretli wendi sympathis with them a littl but she wa far too loyal a housewif to listen to ani complaint against father father know best she alwai said whatev her privat opinion must be her privat opinion wa that the redskin should not call her a squaw we have now reach the even that wa to be known among them as the night of night becaus of it adventur and their upshot the dai as if quietli gather it forc had been almost unev and now the redskin in their blanket were at their post abov while below the children were have their even meal all except peter who had gone out to get the time the wai you got the time on the island wa to find the crocodil and then stai near him till the clock struck the meal happen to be a makebeliev tea and thei sat around the board guzzl in their greed and realli what with their chatter and recrimin the nois as wendi said wa posit deafen to be sure she did not mind nois but she simpli would not have them grab thing and then excus themselv by sai that tootl had push their elbow there wa a fix rule that thei must never hit back at meal but should refer the matter of disput to wendi by rais the right arm polit and sai i complain of soandso but what usual happen wa that thei forgot to do thi or did it too much

an awkward paus follow peter howev wa not the kind that break down befor other peopl ar you readi tinker bell he call out ay ay then lead the wai tink dart up the nearest tree but no on follow her for it wa at thi moment that the pirat made their dread attack upon the redskin abov where all had been so still the air wa rent with shriek and the clash of steel below there wa dead silenc mouth open and remain open wendi fell on her knee but her arm were extend toward peter all arm were extend to him as if suddenli blown in hi direct thei were beseech him mute not to desert them as for peter he seiz hi sword the same he thought he had slain barbecu with and the lust of battl wa in hi ey chapter the children ar carri off the pirat attack had been a complet surpris a sure proof that the unscrupul hook had conduct it improperli for to surpris redskin fairli is beyond the wit of the white man by all the unwritten law of savag warfar it is alwai the redskin who attack and with the wili of hi race he doe it just befor the dawn at which time he know the courag of the white to be at it lowest ebb the white men have in the meantim made a rude stockad on the summit of yonder undul ground at the foot of which a stream run for it is destruct to be too far from water there thei await the onslaught the inexperienc on clutch their revolv and tread on twig but the old hand sleep tranquilli until just befor the dawn through the long black night the savag scout wriggl snakelik among the grass without stir a blade the brushwood close behind them as silent as sand into which a mole ha dive not a sound is to be heard save when thei give vent to a wonder imit of the lone call of the coyot the cry is answer by other brave and some of them do it even better than the coyot who ar not veri good at it so the chill hour wear on and the long suspens is horribl try to the palefac who ha to live through it for the first time but to the train hand those ghastli call and still ghastlier silenc ar but an intim of how the night is march that thi wa the usual procedur wa so well known to hook that in disregard it he cannot be excus on the plea of ignor the piccaninni on their part trust implicitli to hi honour and their whole action of the night stand out in mark contrast to hi thei left noth undon that wa consist with the reput of their tribe with that alert of the sens which is at onc the marvel and despair of civilis peopl thei knew that the pirat were on the island from the moment on of them trod on a dry stick and in an incred short space of time the coyot cri began everi foot of ground between the spot where hook had land hi forc and the home under the tree wa stealthili examin by brave wear their mocassin with the heel in front thei found onli on hillock with a stream at it base so that hook had no choic here he must establish himself and wait for just befor the dawn everyth be thu map out with almost diabol cun the main bodi of the redskin fold their blanket around them and in the phlegmat manner that is to them the pearl of manhood squat abov the children s home await the cold moment when thei should deal pale death here dream though wideawak of the exquisit tortur to which thei were to put him at break of dai those confid savag were found by the treacher hook from the account afterward suppli by such of the scout as escap the carnag he doe not seem even to have paus at the rise ground though it is certain that in that grei light he must have seen it no thought of wait to be attack appear from first to last to have visit hi subtl mind he would not even hold off till the night wa nearli spent on he pound with no polici but to fall to get into combat what could the bewild scout do master as thei were of everi warlik artific save thi on but trot helplessli after him expos themselv fatal to view while thei gave pathet utter to the coyot cry around the brave tiger lili were a dozen of her stoutest warrior and thei suddenli saw the perfidi pirat bear down upon them fell from their ey then the film through which thei had look at victori no more would thei tortur at the stake for them the happi huntingground wa now thei knew it but as their father s son thei acquit themselv even then thei had time to gather in a phalanx dens format that would have been hard to break had thei risen quickli but thi thei were forbidden to do by the tradit of their race it is written that the nobl savag must never express surpris in the presenc of the white thu terribl as the sudden appear of the pirat must have been to them thei remain stationari for a moment not a muscl move as if the foe had come by invit then inde the tradit gallantli upheld thei seiz their weapon and the air wa torn with the warcri but it wa now too late it is no part of our to describ what wa a massacr rather than a fight thu perish mani of the flower of the piccaninni tribe not all unaveng did thei die for with lean wolf fell alf mason to disturb the spanish main no more and among other who bit the dust were geo scouri cha turlei and the alsatian foggerti turlei fell to the tomahawk of the terribl panther who ultim cut a wai through the pirat with tiger lili and a small remnant of the tribe to what extent hook is to blame for hi tactic on thi occas is for the historian to decid had he wait on the rise ground till the proper hour he and hi men would probabl have been butcher and in judg him it is onli fair to take thi into account what he should perhap have done wa to acquaint hi oppon that he propos to follow a new method on the other hand thi as destroi the element of surpris would have made hi strategi of no avail so that the whole question is beset with difficulti on cannot at least withhold a reluct admir for the wit that had conceiv so bold a scheme and the fell deadli geniu with which it wa carri out what were hi own feel about himself at that triumphant moment fain gladli would hi dog have known as breath heavili and wipe their cutlass thei gather at a discreet distanc from hi hook and squint through their ferret ey at thi extraordinari man elat must have been in hi heart but hi face did not reflect it ever a dark and solitari enigma he stood aloof from hi follow in spirit as in substanc the night s work wa not yet over for it wa not the redskin he had come out to destroi thei were but the bee to be smoke so that he should get at the honei it wa pan he want pan and wendi and their band but chiefli pan peter wa such a small boi that on tend to wonder at the man s hatr of him true he had flung hook s arm to the crocodil but even thi and the increas insecur of life to which it led ow to the crocodil s pertinac persist hardli account for a vindict so relentless and malign the truth is that there wa a someth about peter which goad the pirat captain to frenzi it wa not hi courag it wa not hi engag appear it wa not there is no beat about the bush for we know quit well what it wa and have got to tell it wa peter s cocki thi had got on hook s nerv it made hi iron claw twitch and at night it disturb him like an insect while peter live the tortur man felt that he wa a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come the question now wa how to get down the tree or how to get hi dog down he ran hi greedi ey over them search for the thinnest on thei wriggl uncomfort for thei knew he would not scrupl hesit to ram them down with pole in the meantim what of the boi we have seen them at the first clang of the weapon turn as it were into stone figur openmouth all appeal with outstretch arm to peter and we return to them as their mouth close and their arm fall to their side the pandemonium abov ha ceas almost as suddenli as it aros pass like a fierc gust of wind but thei know that in the pass it ha determin their fate which side had won the pirat listen avidli at the mouth of the tree heard the question put by everi boi and ala thei also heard peter s answer if the redskin have won he said thei will beat the tomtom it is alwai their sign of victori now smee had found the tomtom and wa at that moment sit on it you will never hear the tomtom again he mutter but inaud of cours for strict silenc had been enjoin urg to hi amaz hook sign him to beat the tomtom and slowli there came to smee an understand of the dread wicked of the order never probabl had thi simpl man admir hook so much twice smee beat upon the instrument and then stop to listen gleefulli the tomtom the miscreant heard peter cry an indian victori the doom children answer with a cheer that wa music to the black heart abov and almost immedi thei repeat their goodby to peter thi puzzl the pirat but all their other feel were swallow by a base delight that the enemi were about to come up the tree thei smirk at each other and rub their hand rapidli and silent hook gave hi order on man to each tree and the other to arrang themselv in a line two yard apart chapter do you believ in fairi the more quickli thi horror is dispos of the better the first to emerg from hi tree wa curli he rose out of it into the arm of cecco who flung him to smee who flung him to starkei who flung him to bill juke who flung him to noodler and so he wa toss from on to anoth till he fell at the feet of the black pirat all the boi were pluck from their tree in thi ruthless manner and sever of them were in the air at a time like bale of good flung from hand to hand a differ treatment wa accord to wendi who came last with iron polit hook rais hi hat to her and offer her hi arm escort her to the spot where the other were be gag he did it with such an air he wa so frightfulli distingu imposingli distinguish that she wa too fascin to cry out she wa onli a littl girl perhap it is telltal to divulg that for a moment hook entranc her and we tell on her onli becaus her slip led to strang result had she haughtili unhand him and we should have love to write it of her she would have been hurl through the air like the other and then hook would probabl not have been present at the ty of the children and had he not been at the ty he would not have discov slightli s secret and without the secret he could not present have made hi foul attempt on peter s life thei were ti to prevent their fly awai doubl up with their knee close to their ear and for the truss of them the black pirat had cut a rope into nine equal piec all went well until slightli s turn came when he wa found to be like those irrit parcel that us up all the string in go round and leav no tag end with which to tie a knot the pirat kick him in their rage just as you kick the parcel though in fair you should kick the string and strang to sai it wa hook who told them to belai their violenc hi lip wa curl with malici triumph while hi dog were mere sweat becaus everi time thei tri to pack the unhappi lad tight in on part he bulg out in anoth hook s master mind had gone far beneath slightli s surfac probe not for effect but for caus and hi exult show that he had found them slightli white to the gill knew that hook had surpris discov hi secret which wa thi that no boi so blown out could us a tree wherein an averag man need stick poor slightli most wretch of all the children now for he wa in a panic about peter bitterli regret what he had done madli addict to the drink of water when he wa hot he had swell in consequ to hi present girth and instead of reduc himself to fit hi tree he had unknown to the other whittl hi tree to make it fit him suffici of thi hook guess to persuad him that peter at last lai at hi merci but no word of the dark design that now form in the subterranean cavern of hi mind cross hi lip he mere sign that the captiv were to be convei to the ship and that he would be alon how to convei them hunch up in their rope thei might inde be roll down hill like barrel but most of the wai lai through a morass again hook s geniu surmount difficulti he indic that the littl hous must be us as a convey the children were flung into it four stout pirat rais it on their shoulder the other fell in behind and sing the hate pirat choru the strang process set off through the wood i don t know whether ani of the children were cry if so the sing drown the sound but as the littl hous disappear in the forest a brave though tini jet of smoke issu from it chimnei as if defi hook hook saw it and it did peter a bad servic it dri up ani trickl of piti for him that mai have remain in the pirat s infuri breast the first thing he did on find himself alon in the fast fall night wa to tipto to slightli s tree and make sure that it provid him with a passag then for long he remain brood hi hat of ill omen on the sward so that ani gentl breez which had arisen might plai refreshingli through hi hair dark as were hi thought hi blue ey were as soft as the periwinkl intent he listen for ani sound from the nether world but all wa as silent below as abov the hous under the ground seem to be but on more empti tenement in the void wa that boi asleep or did he stand wait at the foot of slightli s tree with hi dagger in hi hand there wa no wai of know save by go down hook let hi cloak slip softli to the ground and then bite hi lip till a lewd blood stood on them he step into the tree he wa a brave man but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe hi brow which wa drip like a candl then silent he let himself go into the unknown he arriv unmolest at the foot of the shaft and stood still again bite at hi breath which had almost left him as hi ey becam accustom to the dim light variou object in the home under the tree took shape but the onli on on which hi greedi gaze rest long sought for and found at last wa the great bed on the bed lai peter fast asleep unawar of the tragedi be enact abov peter had continu for a littl time after the children left to plai gaili on hi pipe no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care then he decid not to take hi medicin so as to griev wendi then he lai down on the bed outsid the coverlet to vex her still more for she had alwai tuck them insid it becaus you never know that you mai not grow chilli at the turn of the night then he nearli cri but it struck him how indign she would be if he laugh instead so he laugh a haughti laugh and fell asleep in the middl of it sometim though not often he had dream and thei were more pain than the dream of other boi for hour he could not be separ from these dream though he wail piteous in them thei had to do i think with the riddl of hi exist at such time it had been wendi s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap sooth him in dear wai of her own invent and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed befor he quit woke up so that he should not know of the indign to which she had subject him but on thi occas he had fallen at onc into a dreamless sleep on arm drop over the edg of the bed on leg wa arch and the unfinish part of hi laugh wa strand on hi mouth which wa open show the littl pearl thu defenceless hook found him he stood silent at the foot of the tree look across the chamber at hi enemi did no feel of compass disturb hi sombr breast the man wa not wholli evil he love flower i have been told and sweet music he wa himself no mean perform on the harpsichord and let it be frankli admit the idyl natur of the scene stir him profoundli master by hi better self he would have return reluctantli up the tree but for on thing what stai him wa peter s impertin appear as he slept the open mouth the droop arm the arch knee thei were such a personif of cocki as taken togeth will never again on mai hope be present to ey so sensit to their offens thei steel hook s heart if hi rage had broken him into a hundr piec everi on of them would have disregard the incid and leapt at the sleeper though a light from the on lamp shone dimli on the bed hook stood in dark himself and at the first stealthi step forward he discov an obstacl the door of slightli s tree it did

nib and john were first and second mate there wa a woman aboard the rest were tar sailor befor the mast and live in the fo c sle peter had alreadi lash himself to the wheel but he pipe all hand and deliv a short address to them said he hope thei would do their duti like gallant hearti but that he knew thei were the scum of rio and the gold coast and if thei snap at him he would tear them the bluff strident word struck the note sailor understood and thei cheer him lustili then a few sharp order were given and thei turn the ship round and nose her for the mainland captain pan calcul after consult the ship s chart that if thi weather last thei should strike the azor about the st of june after which it would save time to fly some of them want it to be an honest ship and other were in favour of keep it a pirat but the captain treat them as dog and thei dare not express their wish to him even in a round robin on person after anoth as thei had to cpt hook instant obedi wa the onli safe thing slightli got a dozen for look perplex when told to take sound the gener feel wa that peter wa honest just now to lull wendi s suspicion but that there might be a chang when the new suit wa readi which against her will she wa make for him out of some of hook s wickedest garment it wa afterward whisper among them that on the first night he wore thi suit he sat long in the cabin with hook s cigarhold in hi mouth and on hand clench all but for the forefing which he bent and held threateningli aloft like a hook instead of watch the ship howev we must now return to that desol home from which three of our charact had taken heartless flight so long ago it seem a shame to have neglect no all thi time and yet we mai be sure that mr darl doe not blame us if we had return sooner to look with sorrow sympathi at her she would probabl have cri don t be silli what do i matter do go back and keep an ey on the children so long as mother ar like thi their children will take advantag of them and thei mai lai to bet on that even now we ventur into that familiar nurseri onli becaus it law occup ar on their wai home we ar mere hurri on in advanc of them to see that their bed ar properli air and that mr and mr darl do not go out for the even we ar no more than servant why on earth should their bed be properli air see that thei left them in such a thankless hurri would it not serv them jolli well right if thei came back and found that their parent were spend the weekend in the countri it would be the moral lesson thei have been in need of ever sinc we met them but if we contriv thing in thi wai mr darl would never forgiv us on thing i should like to do immens and that is to tell her in the wai author have that the children ar come back that inde thei will be here on thursdai week thi would spoil so complet the surpris to which wendi and john and michael ar look forward thei have been plan it out on the ship mother s raptur father s shout of joi nana s leap through the air to embrac them first when what thei ought to be prepar for is a good hide how delici to spoil it all by break the new in advanc so that when thei enter grandli mr darl mai not even offer wendi her mouth and mr darl mai exclaim pettishli dash it all here ar those boi again howev we should get no thank even for thi we ar begin to know mr darl by thi time and mai be sure that she would upbraid us for depriv the children of their littl pleasur but my dear madam it is ten dai till thursdai week so that by tell you what s what we can save you ten dai of unhappi ye but at what a cost by depriv the children of ten minut of delight oh if you look at it in that wai what other wai is there in which to look at it you see the woman had no proper spirit i had meant to sai extraordinarili nice thing about her but i despis her and not on of them will i sai now she doe not realli need to be told to have thing readi for thei ar readi all the bed ar air and she never leav the hous and observ the window is open for all the us we ar to her we might well go back to the ship howev as we ar here we mai as well stai and look on that is all we ar lookerson nobodi realli want us so let us watch and sai jaggi thing in the hope that some of them will hurt the onli chang to be seen in the nightnurseri is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there when the children flew awai mr darl felt in hi bone that all the blame wa hi for have chain nana up and that from first to last she had been wiser than he of cours as we have seen he wa quit a simpl man inde he might have pass for a boi again if he had been abl to take hi bald off but he had also a nobl sens of justic and a lion s courag to do what seem right to him and have thought the matter out with anxiou care after the flight of the children he went down on all four and crawl into the kennel to all mr darl s dear invit to him to come out he repli sadli but firmli no my own on thi is the place for me in the bitter of hi remors he swore that he would never leav the kennel until hi children came back of cours thi wa a piti but whatev mr darl did he had to do in excess otherwis he soon gave up do it and there never wa a more humbl man than the onc proud georg darl as he sat in the kennel of an even talk with hi wife of their children and all their pretti wai veri touch wa hi defer to nana he would not let her come into the kennel but on all other matter he follow her wish implicitli everi morn the kennel wa carri with mr darl in it to a cab which convei him to hi offic and he return home in the same wai at six someth of the strength of charact of the man will be seen if we rememb how sensit he wa to the opinion of neighbour thi man whose everi movement now attract surpris attent inwardli he must have suffer tortur but he preserv a calm exterior even when the young criticis hi littl home and he alwai lift hi hat courteous to ani ladi who look insid it mai have been quixot but it wa magnific soon the

societi invit him to dinner and ad do come in the kennel on that event thursdai week mr darl wa in the nightnurseri await georg s return home a veri sadei woman now that we look at her close and rememb the gaieti of her in the old dai all gone now just becaus she ha lost her babe i find i won t be abl to sai nasti thing about her after all if she wa too fond of her rubbishi children she couldn t help it look at her in her chair where she ha fallen asleep the corner of her mouth where on look first is almost wither up her hand move restlessli on her breast as if she had a pain there some like peter best and some like wendi best but i like her best suppos to make her happi we whisper to her in her sleep that the brat ar come back thei ar realli within two mile of the window now and fly strong but all we need whisper is that thei ar on the wai let s it is a piti we did it for she ha start up call their name and there is no on in the room but nana o nana i dreamt my dear on had come back nana had filmi ey but all she could do wa put her paw gentli on her mistress s lap and thei were sit togeth thu when the kennel wa brought back as mr darl put hi head out to kiss hi wife we see that hi face is more worn than of yore but ha a softer express he gave hi hat to liza who took it scornfulli for she had no imagin and wa quit incap of understand the motiv of such a man outsid the crowd who had accompani the cab home were still cheer and he wa natur not unmov listen to them he said it is veri gratifi lot of littl boi sneer liza there were sever adult todai he assur her with a faint flush but when she toss her head he had not a word of reproof for her social success had not spoilt him it had made him sweeter for some time he sat with hi head out of the kennel talk with mr darl of thi success and press her hand reassuringli when she said she hope hi head would not be turn by it but if i had been a weak man he said good heaven if i had been a weak man and georg she said timidli you ar as full of remors as ever aren t you full of remors as ever dearest see my punish live in a kennel but it is punish isn t it georg you ar sure you ar not enjoi it my love you mai be

he wa asleep and while he slept wendi and john and michael flew into the room oh no we have written it so becaus that wa the charm arrang plan by them befor we left the ship but someth must have happen sinc then for it is not thei who have flown in it is peter and tinker bell peter s first word tell all quick tink he whisper close the window bar it that s right now you and i must get awai by the door and when wendi come she will think her mother ha bar her out and she will have to go back with me now i understand what had hitherto puzzl me why when peter had extermin the pirat he did not return to the island and leav tink to escort the children to the mainland thi trick had been in hi head all the time instead of feel that he wa behav badli he danc with glee then he peep into the daynurseri to see who wa plai he whisper to tink it s wendi s mother she is a pretti ladi but not so pretti as my mother her mouth is full of thimbl but not so full as my mother s wa of cours he knew

then she would not let go of him he skip about and made funni face but when he stop it wa just as if she were insid him knock oh all right he said at last and gulp then he unbar the window come on tink he cri with a fright sneer at the law of natur we don t want ani silli mother and he flew awai thu wendi and john and michael found the window open for them after all which of cours wa more than thei deserv thei alight on the floor quit unasham of themselv and the youngest on had alreadi forgotten hi home john he said look around him doubtfulli i think i have been here befor of cours you have

then ar you not realli our mother wendi ask michael who wa sure sleepi oh dear exclaim wendi with her first real twing of remors for have gone it wa quit time we came back let us creep in john suggest and put our hand over her ey but wendi who saw that thei must break the joyou new more gentli had a better plan let us all slip into our bed and be there when she come in just as if we had never been awai and so when mr darl went back to the nightnurseri to see if her husband wa asleep all the bed were occupi the children wait for her cry of joi but it did not come she saw them but she did not believ thei were there you see she saw them in their bed so often in her dream that she thought thi wa just the dream hang around her still she sat down in the chair by the fire where in the old dai she had nurs them thei could not understand thi and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them mother wendi cri that s wendi she said but still she wa sure it wa the dream mother that s john she said mother cri michael he knew her now that s michael she said and she stretch out her arm for the three littl selfish children thei would never envelop again ye thei did thei went round wendi and john and michael who had slip out of bed and run to her georg georg she cri when she could speak and mr darl woke to share her bliss and nana came rush in there could not have been a loveli sight but there wa none to see it except a littl boi who wa stare in at the window he had had ecstasi innumer that other children can never know but he wa look through the window at the on joi from which he must be for ever bar chapter when wendi grew up i hope you want to know what becam of the other boi thei were wait below to give wendi time to explain about them and when thei had count five hundr thei went up thei went up by the stair becaus thei thought thi would make a better impress thei stood in a row in front of mr darl with their hat off and wish thei were not wear their pirat cloth thei said noth but their ey ask her to have them thei ought to have look at mr darl also but thei forgot about him of cours mr darl said at onc that she would have them but mr darl wa curious depress and thei saw that he consid six a rather larg number i must sai he said to wendi that you don t do thing by halv a grudg remark which the twin thought wa point at them the first twin wa the proud on and he ask flush do you think we should be too much of a hand sir becaus if so we can go awai father wendi cri shock but still the cloud wa on him he knew he wa behav unworthili but he could not help it we could lie doubl up said nib i alwai cut their hair myself said wendi georg mr darl exclaim pain to see her dear on show himself in such an unfavour light then he burst into tear and the truth came out he wa as glad to have them as she wa he said but he thought thei should have ask hi consent as well as her instead of treat him as a cypher zero in hi own hous i don t think he is a cypher tootl cri instantli do you think he is a cypher curli no i don t do you think he is a cypher slightli rather not twin what do you think it turn out that not on of them thought him a cypher and he wa absurdli gratifi and said he would find space for them all in the drawingroom if thei fit in we ll fit in sir thei assur him then follow the leader he cri gaili mind you i am not sure that we have a drawingroom but we pretend we have and it s all the same hoop la he went off danc through the hous and thei all cri hoop la and danc after him search for the drawingroom and i forget whether thei found it but at ani rate thei found corner and thei all fit in as for peter he saw wendi onc again befor he flew awai he did not exactli come to the window but he brush against it in pass so that she could open it if she like and call to him that is what she did hullo wendi goodby he said oh dear ar you go awai ye you don t feel peter she said falteringli that you would like to sai anyth to my parent about a veri sweet subject no about me peter no mr darl came to the window for at present she wa keep a sharp ey on wendi she told peter that she had adopt all the other boi and would like to adopt him also would you send me to school he inquir craftili ye and then to an offic i suppos so soon i would be a man veri soon i don t want to go to school and learn solemn thing he told her passion i don t want to be a man o wendi s mother if i wa to wake up and feel there wa a beard peter said wendi the comfort i should love you in a beard and mr darl stretch out her arm to him but he repuls her keep back ladi no on is go to catch me and make me a man but where ar you go to live with tink in the hous we built for wendi the fairi ar to put it high up among the tree top where thei sleep at night how love cri wendi so longingli that mr darl tighten her grip i thought all the fairi were dead mr darl said there ar alwai a lot of young on explain wendi who wa now quit an author becaus you see when a new babi laugh for the first time a new fairi is born and as there ar alwai new babi there ar alwai new fairi thei live in nest on the top of tree and the mauv on ar boi and the white on ar girl and the blue on ar just littl silli who ar not sure what thei ar i shall have such fun said peter with ey on wendi it will be rather lone in the even she said sit by the fire i shall have tink tink can t go a twentieth part of the wai round she remind him a littl tartli sneaki telltal tink call out from somewher round the corner it doesn t matter peter said o peter you know it matter well then come with me to the littl hous mai i mummi certainli not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he doe so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had ask her from polit mere but mr darl saw hi mouth twitch and she made thi handsom offer to let wendi go to him for a week everi year to do hi spring clean wendi would have prefer a more perman arrang and it seem to her that spring would be long in come but thi promis sent peter awai quit gai again he had no sens of time and wa so full of adventur that all i have told you about him is onli a halfpennyworth of them i suppos it wa becaus wendi knew thi that her last word to him were these rather plaintiv on you won t forget me peter will you befor spring clean time come of cours peter promis and then he flew awai he took mr darl s kiss with him the kiss that had been for no on els peter took quit easili funni but she seem satisfi of cours all the boi went to school and most of them got into class iii but slightli wa put first into class iv and then into class v class i is the top class befor thei had attend school a week thei saw what goat thei had been not to remain on the island but it wa too late now and soon thei settl down to be as ordinari as you or me or jenkin minor the younger jenkin it is sad to have to sai that the power to fly gradual left them at first nana ti their feet to the bedpost so that thei should not fly awai in the night and on of their divers by dai wa to pretend to fall off buse the english doubledeck but by and by thei ceas to tug at their bond in bed and found that thei hurt themselv when thei let go of the bu in time thei could not even fly after their hat want of practic thei call it but what it realli meant wa that thei no longer believ michael believ longer than the other boi though thei jeer at him so he wa with wendi when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew awai with peter in the frock she had woven from leav and berri in the neverland and her on fear wa that he might notic how short it had becom but he never notic he had so much to sai about himself she had look forward to thrill talk with him about old time but new adventur had crowd the old on from hi mind who is captain hook he ask with interest when she spoke of the arch enemi don t you rememb she ask amaz how you kill him and save all our live i forget them after i kill them he repli carelessli when she express a doubt hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said who is tinker bell o peter she said shock but even when she explain he could not rememb there ar such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he wa right for fairi don t live long but thei ar so littl that a short time seem a good while to them wendi wa pain too to find that the past year wa but as yesterdai to peter it had seem such a long year of wait to her but he wa exactli as fascin as ever and thei had a love spring clean in the littl hous on the tree top next year he did not come for her she wait in a new frock becaus the old on simpli would not meet but he never came perhap he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whisper with a shiver perhap there is no such person wendi and then wendi would have cri if michael had not been cry peter came next spring clean and the strang thing wa that he never knew he had miss a year that wa the last time the girl wendi ever saw him for a littl longer she tri for hi sake not to have grow pain and she felt she wa untru to him when she got a prize for gener knowledg but the year came and went without bring the careless boi and when thei met again wendi wa a marri woman and peter wa no more to her than a littl dust in the box in which she had kept her toi wendi wa grown up you need not be sorri for her she wa on of the kind that like to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a dai quicker than other girl all the boi were grown up and done for by thi time so it is scarc worth while sai anyth more about them you mai see the twin and nib and curli ani dai go to an offic each carri a littl bag and an umbrella michael is an enginedriv train engin slightli marri a ladi of titl and so he becam a lord you see that judg in a wig come out at the iron door that us to be tootl the beard man who doesn t know ani stori to tell hi children wa onc john wendi wa marri in white with a pink sash it is strang to think that peter did not alight in the church and forbid the bann formal announc of a marriag year roll on again and wendi had a daughter thi ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash she wa call jane and alwai had an odd inquir look as if from the moment she arriv on the mainland she want to ask question when she wa old enough to ask them thei were mostli about peter pan she love to hear of peter and wendi told her all she could rememb in the veri nurseri from which the famou flight had taken place it wa jane s nurseri now for her father had bought it at the three per cent mortgag rate from wendi s father who wa no longer fond of stair mr darl wa now dead and forgotten there were onli two bed in the nurseri now jane s and her nurs s and there wa no kennel for nana also had pass awai she di of old ag and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with be veri firmli convinc that no on knew how to look after children except herself onc a week jane s nurs had her even off and then it wa wendi s part to put jane to bed that wa the time for stori it wa jane s invent to rais the sheet over her mother s head and her own thu make a tent and in the aw dark to whisper what do we see now i don t think i see anyth tonight sai wendi with a feel that if nana were here she would object to further convers ye you do sai jane you see when you were a littl girl that is a long time ago sweetheart sai wendi ah me how time fli doe it fly ask the art child the wai you flew when you were a littl girl the wai i flew do you know jane i sometim wonder whether i ever did realli fly ye you did the dear old dai when i could fly why can t you fly now mother becaus i am grown up dearest when

with a big breath and then he flew us all awai to the neverland and the fairi and the pirat and the redskin and the mermaid lagoon and the home under the ground and the littl hous ye which did you like best of all i think i like the home under the ground best of all ye so do i what wa the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me wa just alwai be wait for me and then

then the window blew open as of old and peter drop in on the floor he wa exactli the same as ever and wendi saw at onc that he still had all hi first teeth he wa a littl boi and she wa grown up she huddl by the fire not dare to move helpless and guilti a big woman hullo wendi he said not notic ani differ for he wa think chiefli of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the
